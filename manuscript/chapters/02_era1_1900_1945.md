# Era 1: 1900-1945 — Mechanical Cryptography & Computing Foundations

## Overview

The World Wars transformed cryptography from a craft to a science. Mechanical cipher machines—culminating in the infamous Enigma—created complexity beyond human calculation. Breaking them required computational machines, giving birth to the computer. Alan Turing's work at Bletchley Park not only shortened the war but established theoretical foundations for all computation. His 1936 paper on computable numbers defined what a "computer" could do—a concept directly embodied in the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

## The Rotor Machine Revolution

### Early Rotor Machines

Multiple inventors independently developed electromechanical cipher machines:

| Inventor | Machine | Year | Country |
|----------|---------|------|---------|
| **Edward Hebern** | Hebern Rotor Machine | 1917 | USA |
| **Hugo Koch** | Enigma prototype | 1919 | Netherlands |
| **Arthur Scherbius** | Enigma | 1918 | Germany |
| **Arvid Damm** / **Boris Hagelin** | Various (C-36, etc.) | 1920s | Sweden |

### The Concept

**Rotors** implement polyalphabetic substitution mechanically:
- Each rotor performs one substitution
- After each letter, rotors step (like an odometer)
- Multiple rotors multiply complexity

```
Input → Rotor 1 → Rotor 2 → Rotor 3 → Reflector → Rotor 3 → Rotor 2 → Rotor 1 → Output
```

## The Enigma Machine

### Design

The German Enigma (military version):
- **3-4 rotors** (from set of 5-8)
- **Plugboard** (Steckerbrett): 10 letter swaps
- **Reflector**: No letter encrypts to itself
- Daily settings: rotor order, rotor positions, plugboard settings

### Key Space

```
Rotor order:     60 combinations (5 choose 3, ordered)
Rotor positions: 26 × 26 × 26 = 17,576
Plugboard:       ~150 trillion combinations

Total: ~158 quintillion possible settings
```

This exceeded any brute-force attack with 1940s technology.

### The Flaw

Despite enormous key space, Enigma had exploitable weaknesses:
- **No letter encrypts to itself** (reflector design)
- **Predictable message headers** ("weather report," dates)
- **Operator errors** (reused settings, predictable keys)
- **Known plaintext** (standardized military formats)

---

## Breaking Enigma

### Polish Contribution (1932-1939)

**Marian Rejewski**, **Jerzy Różycki**, and **Henryk Zygalski** at the Polish Cipher Bureau:
- Mathematically analyzed Enigma (1932)
- Built "Bomba" machines to find rotor settings
- Shared all work with British and French (July 1939)

**Significance**: Without Polish groundwork, British success would have been delayed or impossible.

### Bletchley Park (1939-1945)

British codebreaking headquarters:
- ~10,000 staff at peak
- Multiple "Huts" for different cipher systems
- Ultra intelligence: Decrypted Axis communications

### The Bombe

**Alan Turing** and **Gordon Welchman** designed electromechanical "Bombe" machines:
- Not computers (single-purpose)
- Tested possible Enigma settings
- Used known plaintext to find contradictions
- ~200 Bombes built by war's end

## Alan Turing (1912-1954)

### Before Bletchley

**1936: "On Computable Numbers"**

Turing's theoretical paper defined:
- **Turing machines**: Abstract computational model
- **Universal Turing machine**: A machine that can simulate any other
- **Computability**: What problems can be solved algorithmically
- **The halting problem**: Some problems are undecidable

**Key insight**: Any computation can be performed by manipulating symbols according to rules. This abstraction underlies all computers—including the EVM.

### At Bletchley

- Arrived September 1939
- Designed improved Bombe (1940)
- Cracked naval Enigma (critical for Atlantic convoys)
- Worked on Lorenz cipher ("Tunny")

### After the War

- ACE computer design (1945)
- Manchester computers (1948)
- AI research ("Computing Machinery and Intelligence," 1950)
- Morphogenesis research
- Prosecuted for homosexuality (1952); died 1954

**Legacy**: Foundational figure for computer science, AI, and by extension blockchain.

## Colossus: The First Electronic Computer

### The Lorenz Cipher

Germany's High Command used Lorenz SZ40/42 ("Tunny"):
- More complex than Enigma
- Teleprinter cipher
- 12 wheels with 501 pins

### The Machine

**Colossus** (December 1943):
- Designed by **Tommy Flowers**
- 1,500 vacuum tubes (Colossus II: 2,400)
- Read paper tape at 5,000 characters/second
- First large-scale electronic computer

**Capabilities**:
- Programmable (via switches and plugboards)
- Boolean logic operations
- Statistical analysis of ciphertext

**Significance**: Proved electronic computation viable at scale. Remained classified until 1970s.

## Claude Shannon: Information Theory Foundations

### Background

**Claude Shannon** (1916-2001): Bell Labs engineer; MIT professor.

During WWII, worked on:
- Fire control systems
- Cryptographic systems (secret work)

### Key Insight

Shannon connected:
- **Information** (bits)
- **Communication** (channel capacity)
- **Cryptography** (security proofs)

His classified 1945 report "A Mathematical Theory of Cryptography" laid groundwork for modern cryptography (published 1949 as "Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems").

## Wartime Cryptographic Lessons

### What Worked

| Success Factor | Example |
|----------------|---------|
| **Mathematical analysis** | Rejewski's Enigma work |
| **Machine assistance** | Bombe, Colossus |
| **Collaboration** | Polish-British intelligence sharing |
| **Known plaintext** | Exploiting message formats |

### What Failed

| Failure | Lesson |
|---------|--------|
| **Design flaws** (Enigma reflector) | No letter → itself enabled elimination |
| **Operational security** | Human error trumps cryptographic strength |
| **Overconfidence** | Germans believed Enigma unbreakable |
| **Secret algorithms** | Captured machines revealed design |

---

## Non-Axis Cryptography

### US SIGABA (M-134-C)

American cipher machine:
- 15 rotors (irregular stepping)
- Never broken during the war
- More complex than Enigma

### British TypeX

Modified commercial Enigma:
- Added security features
- Avoided Enigma's reflector flaw

### Japanese PURPLE

Japanese diplomatic cipher:
- Electromechanical stepping switches (not rotors)
- Broken by **William Friedman** and team (1940)
- "Magic" intelligence

---

## Computing Theory Emerges

### Turing's Theoretical Framework

**Turing machines** provide:
- Definition of "algorithm"
- Proof of computational limits
- Universal computation concept

```
Turing Machine:
- Infinite tape (memory)
- Read/write head
- State register
- Transition rules

Any computable function can be computed by some Turing machine.
```

### Church-Turing Thesis

**Alonzo Church** and Turing independently proved equivalent results (1936):
- Lambda calculus (Church)
- Turing machines (Turing)
- Both define the same class of computable functions

**Implication**: There's a fundamental limit to what can be computed, regardless of machine design.

### Von Neumann Architecture (1945)

**John von Neumann's** "First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC" described:
- Stored-program computer
- Central processing unit
- Memory storing both data and programs
- Input/output

This architecture dominates computing today, including the machines running Ethereum nodes.

## EVM Relevance

### Turing Completeness

The EVM is explicitly designed as a **Turing-complete** virtual machine:
- Can compute anything computable (given enough resources)
- Named in honor of Turing's theoretical work
- Gas limits prevent the halting problem in practice

```
Turing machine: Unlimited tape, potentially infinite execution
EVM: Gas limit ensures termination
```

### Computational Limits

Turing's work established:
- Some problems are undecidable
- Smart contract verification has theoretical limits
- The halting problem is why gas limits exist

### Wartime Lessons Applied

| WWII Pattern | Blockchain Equivalent |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Known plaintext attacks | Known message format exploits |
| Operator errors critical | Private key management crucial |
| Complexity ≠ security | Code complexity invites bugs |
| Open algorithm (captured Enigma) | Open-source blockchain code |

## Common Misattributions

### 1. "The British broke Enigma"

**Reality**: Polish mathematicians broke Enigma (1932). British work built on Polish foundations shared in 1939. Credit should be shared.

**Confidence**: HIGH

### 2. "ENIAC was the first computer"

**Reality**: Colossus (1943) predates ENIAC (1945). However, Colossus was classified, and ENIAC was general-purpose in design.

**Confidence**: HIGH (definitional debate about "computer")

### 3. "Turing invented the computer"

**Reality**: Turing provided theoretical foundations. Multiple inventors built physical computers (Flowers, von Neumann, Zuse, etc.). Theory and implementation were collaborative.

**Confidence**: HIGH

## Open Questions

1. **Alternative histories**: How different would computing be without wartime pressure?

2. **Colossus influence**: Did classified Colossus knowledge accelerate post-war computing?

3. **GCHQ secret history**: What other cryptographic developments remain classified?
