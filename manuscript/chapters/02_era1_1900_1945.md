# Era 1: 1900-1945 — Mechanical Cryptography & Computing Foundations

## Overview

The World Wars transformed cryptography from a craft to a science. Mechanical cipher machines—culminating in the infamous Enigma—created complexity beyond human calculation. Breaking them required computational machines, giving birth to the computer. Alan Turing's work at Bletchley Park not only shortened the war but established theoretical foundations for all computation. His 1936 paper on computable numbers defined what a "computer" could do—a concept directly embodied in the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

## The Rotor Machine Revolution

### Early Rotor Machines

Multiple inventors independently developed electromechanical cipher machines:

| Inventor | Machine | Year | Country |
|----------|---------|------|---------|
| **Edward Hebern** | Hebern Rotor Machine | 1917 | USA |
| **Hugo Koch** | Enigma prototype | 1919 | Netherlands |
| **Arthur Scherbius** | Enigma | 1918 | Germany |
| **Arvid Damm** / **Boris Hagelin** | Various (C-36, etc.) | 1920s | Sweden |

### The Concept

**Rotors** implement polyalphabetic substitution mechanically:
- Each rotor performs one substitution
- After each letter, rotors step (like an odometer)
- Multiple rotors multiply complexity

```
Input → Rotor 1 → Rotor 2 → Rotor 3 → Reflector → Rotor 3 → Rotor 2 → Rotor 1 → Output
```

---

## The Enigma Machine

### Design

The German Enigma (military version):
- **3-4 rotors** (from set of 5-8)
- **Plugboard** (Steckerbrett): 10 letter swaps
- **Reflector**: No letter encrypts to itself
- Daily settings: rotor order, rotor positions, plugboard settings

### Key Space

```
Rotor order:     60 combinations (5 choose 3, ordered)
Rotor positions: 26 × 26 × 26 = 17,576
Plugboard:       ~150 trillion combinations

Total: ~158 quintillion possible settings
```

This exceeded any brute-force attack with 1940s technology.

### The Flaw

Despite enormous key space, Enigma had exploitable weaknesses:
- **No letter encrypts to itself** (reflector design)
- **Predictable message headers** ("weather report," dates)
- **Operator errors** (reused settings, predictable keys)
- **Known plaintext** (standardized military formats)

---

## Breaking Enigma

### Polish Contribution (1932-1939)

**Marian Rejewski**, **Jerzy Różycki**, and **Henryk Zygalski** at the Polish Cipher Bureau:
- Mathematically analyzed Enigma (1932)
- Built "Bomba" machines to find rotor settings
- Shared all work with British and French (July 1939)

**Significance**: Without Polish groundwork, British success would have been delayed or impossible.

### Bletchley Park (1939-1945)

British codebreaking headquarters:
- ~10,000 staff at peak
- Multiple "Huts" for different cipher systems
- Ultra intelligence: Decrypted Axis communications

### The Bombe

**Alan Turing** and **Gordon Welchman** designed electromechanical "Bombe" machines:
- Not computers (single-purpose)
- Tested possible Enigma settings
- Used known plaintext to find contradictions
- ~200 Bombes built by war's end

## Alan Turing (1912-1954)

### Before Bletchley

**1936: "On Computable Numbers"**

Turing's theoretical paper defined:
- **Turing machines**: Abstract computational model
- **Universal Turing machine**: A machine that can simulate any other
- **Computability**: What problems can be solved algorithmically
- **The halting problem**: Some problems are undecidable

**Key insight**: Any computation can be performed by manipulating symbols according to rules. This abstraction underlies all computers—including the EVM.

### At Bletchley

- Arrived September 1939
- Designed improved Bombe (1940)
- Cracked naval Enigma (critical for Atlantic convoys)
- Worked on Lorenz cipher ("Tunny")

### After the War

- ACE computer design (1945)
- Manchester computers (1948)
- AI research ("Computing Machinery and Intelligence," 1950)
- Morphogenesis research
- Prosecuted for homosexuality (1952); died 1954

**Legacy**: Foundational figure for computer science, AI, and by extension blockchain.

## Colossus: The First Electronic Computer

### The Lorenz Cipher

Germany's High Command used Lorenz SZ40/42 ("Tunny"):
- More complex than Enigma
- Teleprinter cipher
- 12 wheels with 501 pins

### The Machine

**Colossus** (December 1943):
- Designed by **Tommy Flowers**
- 1,500 vacuum tubes (Colossus II: 2,400)
- Read paper tape at 5,000 characters/second
- First large-scale electronic computer

**Capabilities**:
- Programmable (via switches and plugboards)
- Boolean logic operations
- Statistical analysis of ciphertext

**Significance**: Proved electronic computation viable at scale. Remained classified until 1970s.

---

## Claude Shannon: Information Theory Foundations

### Background

**Claude Shannon** (1916-2001): Bell Labs engineer; MIT professor.

During WWII, worked on:
- Fire control systems
- Cryptographic systems (secret work)

### Key Insight

Shannon connected:
- **Information** (bits)
- **Communication** (channel capacity)
- **Cryptography** (security proofs)

His classified 1945 report "A Mathematical Theory of Cryptography" laid groundwork for modern cryptography (published 1949 as "Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems").

## Wartime Cryptographic Lessons

### What Worked

| Success Factor | Example |
|----------------|---------|
| **Mathematical analysis** | Rejewski's Enigma work |
| **Machine assistance** | Bombe, Colossus |
| **Collaboration** | Polish-British intelligence sharing |
| **Known plaintext** | Exploiting message formats |

### What Failed

| Failure | Lesson |
|---------|--------|
| **Design flaws** (Enigma reflector) | No letter → itself enabled elimination |
| **Operational security** | Human error trumps cryptographic strength |
| **Overconfidence** | Germans believed Enigma unbreakable |
| **Secret algorithms** | Captured machines revealed design |

---

## Non-Axis Cryptography

### US SIGABA (M-134-C)

American cipher machine:
- 15 rotors (irregular stepping)
- Never broken during the war
- More complex than Enigma

### British TypeX

Modified commercial Enigma:
- Added security features
- Avoided Enigma's reflector flaw

### Japanese PURPLE

Japanese diplomatic cipher:
- Electromechanical stepping switches (not rotors)
- Broken by **William Friedman** and team (1940)
- "Magic" intelligence

---

## Computing Theory Emerges

### Turing's Theoretical Framework

**Turing machines** provide:
- Definition of "algorithm"
- Proof of computational limits
- Universal computation concept

```
Turing Machine:
- Infinite tape (memory)
- Read/write head
- State register
- Transition rules

Any computable function can be computed by some Turing machine.
```

### Church-Turing Thesis

**Alonzo Church** and Turing independently proved equivalent results (1936):
- Lambda calculus (Church)
- Turing machines (Turing)
- Both define the same class of computable functions

**Implication**: There's a fundamental limit to what can be computed, regardless of machine design.

### Von Neumann Architecture (1945)

**John von Neumann's** "First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC" described:
- Stored-program computer
- Central processing unit
- Memory storing both data and programs
- Input/output

This architecture dominates computing today, including the machines running Ethereum nodes.

## Women in WWII Cryptography

The wartime codebreaking effort relied heavily on women, who comprised the majority of workers at both Bletchley Park and American cryptanalytic facilities. Their contributions have been systematically underrepresented in histories of cryptography.

### Bletchley Park Women

**Joan Clarke (1917-1996)**

One of the few women cryptanalysts (as opposed to clerical staff) at Bletchley Park:
- B.A. Mathematics, Newnham College, Cambridge (1939); Double First (though Cambridge didn't award women full degrees until 1948)
- Recruited to Bletchley Park directly from university (June 1940)
- Assigned to Hut 8 (Naval Enigma) under Alan Turing and Hugh Alexander
- Rose to Deputy Head of Hut 8 — the only woman in senior cryptanalytic role
- Developed the method of "Banburismus" alongside Turing for eliminating possible Enigma wheel orders
- Briefly engaged to Alan Turing (he broke it off, revealing his homosexuality)
- Awarded MBE for her wartime service
- Worked at GCHQ until retirement (1977)
- Technical advisor for the 2014 film "The Imitation Game"

**Historical significance**: Clarke performed the same cryptanalytic work as her male colleagues but was officially classified as a "linguist" due to civil service rules barring women from higher pay grades. Her mathematical contributions to breaking Naval Enigma — which protected German U-boat communications — directly impacted the Battle of the Atlantic.

**Mavis Batey (née Lever, 1921-2013)**

Cryptanalyst who broke critical Axis communications:
- Read German at University College London; recruited at age 19
- Assigned to Dilly Knox's team working on Italian and Abwehr (German intelligence) Enigma
- **March 1941**: Broke the Italian Naval Enigma, enabling the British victory at the **Battle of Cape Matapan** (three Italian cruisers and two destroyers sunk)
- **December 1941**: Broke the Abwehr Enigma used by German intelligence services
- Her break into Abwehr codes enabled Double Cross System (turning German agents)
- Contributed to D-Day deception operations (Operation Fortitude)
- Post-war: Garden historian and conservationist; founding member of Garden History Society

**Historical significance**: Batey's break of the Abwehr Enigma was essential for counterintelligence. The Double Cross System, which fed disinformation to Germany through turned agents, depended on reading Abwehr traffic to ensure the deception was believed.

**Margaret Rock (1903-1983)**

Senior cryptanalyst in Dilly Knox's section:
- Worked on Italian Naval Enigma and Abwehr Enigma alongside Mavis Lever
- Credited by Knox as essential to the Italian break
- One of only a handful of women doing analytical (vs. clerical) work
- Later recognized as one of the key Enigma breakers

### American Women Codebreakers

**Elizebeth Smith Friedman (1892-1980)**

Pioneer cryptanalyst often called the "Mother of American Cryptology":
- B.A. Hillsdale College (1915); graduate study in English literature
- Self-taught cryptanalyst; began career at Riverbank Laboratories (1916) alongside future husband William Friedman
- **1920s-1930s**: Led US Coast Guard cryptanalytic unit breaking rum-runner codes during Prohibition; testified in court as expert witness
- **1930s**: Broke codes of international narcotics and smuggling rings
- **WWII**: Worked for the Coast Guard and OSS (precursor to CIA) breaking Axis communications in the Western Hemisphere
- Broke Nazi spy ring communications (Clandestine Enigma); her work led to arrests and neutralization of German espionage networks in South America
- **Total**: Broke over 4,000 encrypted messages during career
- Inducted into NSA Hall of Honor (1999, posthumously)

**Historical significance**: Elizebeth Friedman's work was systematically attributed to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who claimed FBI credit for breaking the Nazi spy rings. Her true role was classified for decades. She and William Friedman are the only married couple in the NSA Hall of Honor.

**The "Code Girls" — Arlington Hall (1942-1945)**

Over 11,000 women served as cryptanalysts and support staff for the US Army Signal Intelligence Service:
- Recruited from women's colleges across the United States
- Trained in mathematics, cryptanalysis, and Japanese/German language
- Worked at Arlington Hall Station (Army) and Naval Communications Annex
- By 1945, women comprised approximately **70% of the US Army's codebreaking workforce**
- Broke Japanese Army codes, shipping ciphers, and diplomatic communications
- Contributions remained classified for 70 years
- Sworn to secrecy; many never revealed their wartime work even to spouses

Key figures among the Code Girls:
- **Ann Caracristi** (1921-2016): Rose to Deputy Director of NSA (1980) — the first woman in that role. Broke Japanese Army ciphers.
- **Genevieve Grotjan Feinstein** (1913-2006): Made the critical cryptanalytic breakthrough enabling the break of Japanese PURPLE cipher (1940), though credit was given to William Friedman's team collectively.

**Historical significance**: The Code Girls produced intelligence that shortened the Pacific War and saved countless lives. Their systematic exclusion from historical accounts until Liza Mundy's 2017 book "Code Girls" represents a significant historiographical correction.

### Why This Matters

The underrepresentation of women in cryptographic history has parallels in technology fields:

| Pattern | WWII | Modern Tech |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Work attributed to male supervisors | Clarke's work → Turing | Common pattern |
| Official classification bars women | "Linguist" vs. "Cryptanalyst" | Job title disparities |
| Secrecy hides contributions | Classified until 1970s-2000s | NDAs, proprietary work |
| Numbers underestimated | 70% of Army codebreaking | Developer surveys undercount |

Understanding this historical pattern is relevant for accurately documenting blockchain and cryptocurrency history, where similar attribution gaps exist (see: Cynthia Dwork's often-overlooked co-invention of proof of work).

## EVM Relevance

### Turing Completeness

The EVM is explicitly designed as a **Turing-complete** virtual machine:
- Can compute anything computable (given enough resources)
- Named in honor of Turing's theoretical work
- Gas limits prevent the halting problem in practice

```
Turing machine: Unlimited tape, potentially infinite execution
EVM: Gas limit ensures termination
```

### Computational Limits

Turing's work established:
- Some problems are undecidable
- Smart contract verification has theoretical limits
- The halting problem is why gas limits exist

### Wartime Lessons Applied

| WWII Pattern | Blockchain Equivalent |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Known plaintext attacks | Known message format exploits |
| Operator errors critical | Private key management crucial |
| Complexity ≠ security | Code complexity invites bugs |
| Open algorithm (captured Enigma) | Open-source blockchain code |

## Common Misattributions

### 1. "The British broke Enigma"

**Reality**: Polish mathematicians broke Enigma (1932). British work built on Polish foundations shared in 1939. Credit should be shared.

**Confidence**: HIGH

### 2. "ENIAC was the first computer"

**Reality**: Colossus (1943) predates ENIAC (1945). However, Colossus was classified, and ENIAC was general-purpose in design.

**Confidence**: HIGH (definitional debate about "computer")

### 3. "Turing invented the computer"

**Reality**: Turing provided theoretical foundations. Multiple inventors built physical computers (Flowers, von Neumann, Zuse, etc.). Theory and implementation were collaborative.

**Confidence**: HIGH

---

## Open Questions

1. **Alternative histories**: How different would computing be without wartime pressure?

2. **Colossus influence**: Did classified Colossus knowledge accelerate post-war computing?

3. **GCHQ secret history**: What other cryptographic developments remain classified?

4. **Attribution gaps**: How many other women's contributions to cryptography remain undocumented or misattributed?

5. **Computing precursors**: Beyond Colossus, what other wartime computing projects remain classified?

## Bridge to Era 2

By 1945, the wartime cryptographic effort had achieved:

**What Was Established**:
- Electronic computing was viable at scale (Colossus)
- Turing machines defined theoretical computation limits
- Stored-program architecture (von Neumann) would dominate
- Mathematical cryptanalysis superseded linguistic methods
- Information theory was emerging (Shannon's classified work)

**What Remained**:
- All ciphers still symmetric (shared secrets)
- Key distribution unsolved
- Most cryptographic knowledge classified
- No public academic cryptography
- No formal security proofs

**The Transition**: The wartime apparatus became the Cold War intelligence infrastructure. NSA (1952) and GCHQ would dominate cryptography for decades, classifying most advances. Meanwhile, computer science emerged as a distinct field, and Shannon's work would be declassified—laying foundations for the information age.

**What came next** (Era 2, 1945-1975):
- **1948**: Shannon's "Mathematical Theory of Communication" published
- **1949**: Shannon's secrecy systems paper declassified
- **1952**: NSA established
- **1969**: ARPANET operational
- **1975**: DES proposed as federal standard

Era 2 would see cryptography transform from an art to a mathematical science, while government maintained its grip on cryptographic knowledge—setting the stage for the public key revolution.
