# Era 6: 2013-2017 — Ethereum Launch

## Overview

In late 2013, a 19-year-old Bitcoin Magazine writer named Vitalik Buterin proposed a new blockchain: one where you could program arbitrary applications, not just currency transfers. By July 2015, Ethereum launched as the first general-purpose blockchain with a Turing-complete virtual machine. Within a year, it would face its first existential crisis—The DAO hack—forcing the community to choose between code and consensus.

This era spans Ethereum's conception, design, launch, and the formative events that shaped its philosophy.

## The Ethereum Concept

### Why Ethereum Was Needed

By 2013, developers were hitting Bitcoin's limitations:

| Limitation | Consequence |
|------------|-------------|
| Non-Turing-complete Script | Couldn't build complex applications |
| No persistent state | Contracts couldn't remember anything |
| UTXO-only | Awkward for non-currency applications |
| Conservative development | Hard to add features |

Projects like Mastercoin and Colored Coins tried to build on Bitcoin, but remained constrained by its design. Buterin initially proposed adding scripting to Mastercoin, but concluded a new platform was needed.

### The Whitepaper (Late 2013)

Buterin's whitepaper proposed:

> "A blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language, allowing anyone to write smart contracts and decentralized applications."

[@whitepaper_buterin_ethereum_2013]

Key innovations proposed:
1. **Account-based model** (not UTXO)
2. **Turing-complete VM** with gas metering
3. **Persistent storage** per contract
4. **Native token** (ether) for computation fees

### The Founding Team

The original eight co-founders:
- **Vitalik Buterin**: Whitepaper author, protocol research
- **Gavin Wood**: Yellow Paper, EVM specification, Solidity
- **Joseph Lubin**: ConsenSys founder, enterprise adoption
- **Anthony Di Iorio**: Early funder
- **Mihai Alisie**: Ethereum Switzerland
- **Charles Hoskinson**: Left to found Cardano
- **Amir Chetrit**: Early contributor
- **Jeffrey Wilcke**: Go-Ethereum lead

The team had early tensions over Ethereum's direction (for-profit vs. non-profit), leading to several departures.

## EVM Design Decisions

### Why Stack-Based?

The EVM uses a stack machine (like Java bytecode) rather than a register machine (like x86):

| Aspect | Stack Machine | Register Machine |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| Simplicity | Higher | Lower |
| Code size | Smaller | Larger |
| Formal verification | Easier | Harder |
| Optimization | Harder | Easier |

The choice prioritized:
- **Simplicity**: Fewer states to track
- **Determinism**: Same execution across all nodes
- **Security**: Easier to audit and verify

### Why 256-Bit Words?

The EVM operates on 256-bit (32-byte) words because:
1. **Cryptography alignment**: SHA-256 hashes, ECDSA signatures
2. **Large numbers**: Native big integer support
3. **Storage efficiency**: One word = one storage slot

Trade-off: Wasteful for small values (boolean as 256 bits).

### The Gas Model

Gavin Wood designed gas metering to:
- **Prevent infinite loops**: Computation must terminate
- **Price resources fairly**: Storage costs more than computation
- **Enable markets**: Users bid for block space

[@yellowpaper_wood_ethereum_2014]

```
Transaction cost = gas_used × gas_price
```

Gas prices are set by users; miners prioritize higher-paying transactions.

## The Crowdsale (2014)

### Structure

- **Duration**: July 22 - September 2, 2014 (42 days)
- **Currency**: BTC only
- **Raised**: 31,529 BTC (~$18.4M at time)
- **ETH sold**: ~60 million ETH
- **Initial price**: ~2,000 ETH per BTC (first 14 days)

### Distribution

| Allocation | Amount | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Crowdsale participants | ~60M ETH | Initial distribution |
| Ethereum Foundation | ~12M ETH | Development funding |
| Early contributors | Varied | Compensation |

This made Ethereum one of the largest crowdfunded projects at the time.

### Legal Considerations

The crowdsale predated SEC crypto guidance. Ethereum's status (security vs. commodity) remained ambiguous until 2018 when the SEC declared ETH was not a security due to sufficient decentralization.

## Mainnet Launch: Frontier (July 30, 2015)

### Technical Specifications at Launch

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Block time | ~15 seconds |
| Block gas limit | 5,000 (initially; increased rapidly) |
| Mining algorithm | Ethash (memory-hard) |
| Consensus | Proof of work |
| Difficulty bomb | Activated |

### Frontier vs. Later Phases

Ethereum planned phased releases:
1. **Frontier** (2015): Barebones, for developers
2. **Homestead** (2016): Stability improvements
3. **Metropolis** (2017-2019): Byzantium, Constantinople
4. **Serenity** (planned): Proof of stake (eventually The Merge, 2022)

### Early Gas Limits

The initial 5,000 gas limit was intentionally restrictive—barely enough to send a transaction. This was increased manually by miners as confidence grew.

---

## The DAO: Rise and Fall

### What Was The DAO?

The DAO ("Decentralized Autonomous Organization") was:
- An investment fund controlled by smart contracts
- Managed by token holder votes
- "Code is law" philosophy embodied

Launched April 2016 by Slock.it. Raised 11.5M ETH (~$150M)—the largest crowdfund in history at that time.

### The Code

The DAO's core contract allowed:
1. **Proposals**: Anyone could propose funding requests
2. **Voting**: DAO token holders voted
3. **Split**: Minority could exit with their share

The "split" function had a critical vulnerability.

### The Vulnerability: Reentrancy

The DAO's `splitDAO` function:

```
1. Check user's balance
2. Send ETH to user
3. Update user's balance to zero
```

The problem: Step 2 (send ETH) triggers the recipient's fallback function, which can call `splitDAO` again **before step 3 executes**.

```
Attacker calls splitDAO
  → Contract sends ETH
    → Attacker's fallback calls splitDAO again
      → Contract sends ETH again (balance not yet updated)
        → Repeat until drained
```

This "reentrancy" attack pattern remains the most dangerous smart contract vulnerability.

### The Attack (June 17, 2016)

Over several hours, an attacker drained ~3.6M ETH (~$60M at time) into a "child DAO."

The child DAO had a 27-day lockup period—giving the community time to respond.

### The Community Response

Options considered:

| Option | Description | Proponents |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Do nothing** | Code is law; attack was legal | Immutability purists |
| **Soft fork** | Blacklist attacker's funds | Moderate intervention |
| **Hard fork** | Revert state; return funds | DAO investors |

### The Fork Decision

A carbonvote (coin-weighted voting) showed 87% support for a hard fork.

Arguments for forking:
- $60M at stake
- Attacker exploited bug, not intended behavior
- Early enough to establish precedent

Arguments against:
- Violates "code is law"
- Sets precedent for bailouts
- Centralized decision-making

### The Split: ETH and ETC (July 20, 2016)

At block 1,920,000:
- **Ethereum (ETH)**: Forked chain; DAO funds returned
- **Ethereum Classic (ETC)**: Original chain; attacker keeps funds

Both chains continue operating today.

## ETH vs ETC: Philosophical Divide

### Ethereum (ETH) Position

"The community can coordinate to fix bugs and protect users. Social consensus matters."

- Irregular state changes acceptable in extreme circumstances
- Pragmatism over purity
- The network is the community, not just the code

### Ethereum Classic (ETC) Position

"Code is law. If you don't like the outcome, write better code."

- Immutability is non-negotiable
- Hard forks for bailouts create moral hazard
- Trust the protocol, not the developers

### Long-term Implications

The fork established that Ethereum would prioritize community consensus over strict immutability—a philosophy that enabled later upgrades like The Merge.

ETC continues as a minority chain, maintaining the original chain's history.

## EVM Design: Technical Deep Dive

### The Yellow Paper

Gavin Wood's formal specification defined:
- State transition function
- Every opcode and its gas cost
- Account structure
- Transaction validation rules

[@yellowpaper_wood_ethereum_2014]

This allowed independent client implementations to achieve consensus.

### Account Types

| Type | Has Code | Has Balance | Controlled By |
|------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| EOA (Externally Owned Account) | No | Yes | Private key |
| Contract | Yes | Yes | Its code |

### Storage Model

```
World State = mapping(address → account)
Account = (nonce, balance, storageRoot, codeHash)
Storage = mapping(uint256 → uint256)
```

Storage is expensive because all nodes must maintain it forever.

### Execution Model

```
Transaction received
  → Validate signature and nonce
  → Deduct gas × gasPrice from sender
  → Execute code in EVM
  → If success: commit state changes
  → If failure: revert state; gas still consumed
```

## Decentralized Storage Context

### IPFS (2014)

**InterPlanetary File System** by Protocol Labs:
- Content-addressed storage
- Files identified by hash, not location
- Distributed network of nodes
- Complements Ethereum (store data off-chain, hash on-chain)

[@whitepaper_benet_ipfs_2014]

### Swarm

Ethereum's native storage layer:
- Incentivized storage (BZZ token)
- Integrated with Ethereum ecosystem
- Launched later than expected

### Filecoin (2017)

IPFS incentivized with cryptocurrency:
- Proof of Replication
- Proof of Spacetime
- $257M ICO (largest at time)

[@whitepaper_filecoin_2017]

## EVM Relevance

This is the EVM's origin story. Key design decisions made in 2014-2015 persist:

| Decision | Rationale | Still Relevant? |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Stack-based | Simplicity | Yes; EVM Object Format (EOF) modernizes |
| 256-bit words | Crypto alignment | Yes; wasteful but unchangeable |
| Account model | State flexibility | Yes; foundation of all EVM chains |
| Gas metering | Anti-DoS | Yes; EIP-1559 refined pricing |
| Solidity | Accessibility | Yes; dominant language |

Understanding these decisions explains many EVM constraints and opportunities.

---

## Common Misattributions

### 1. "Vitalik Buterin created the EVM"

**Reality**: Buterin authored the whitepaper. **Gavin Wood** designed and formally specified the EVM in the Yellow Paper.

**Confidence**: HIGH

### 2. "The DAO hack was a theft"

**Reality**: The attacker exploited code as written. Whether this constitutes "theft" depends on whether you believe "code is law." The forked chain treated it as theft; the original chain (ETC) did not.

**Confidence**: HIGH (contested philosophical question)

### 3. "Ethereum was the first smart contract platform"

**Reality**: Counterparty (2014) and Mastercoin (2013) attempted smart contracts on Bitcoin. Ethereum was the first **general-purpose** platform with a Turing-complete VM as the base layer.

**Confidence**: HIGH

---

## Open Questions

1. **Would Ethereum have survived without the fork?** The DAO represented ~15% of all ETH. A $60M loss at that stage could have been fatal.

2. **Why secp256k1?** Ethereum copied Bitcoin's curve choice. Was this the right decision?

3. **Could the EVM have been designed differently?** WASM, register-based machines, and other VMs exist. Would a different design have been better?

4. **What if Homestead had been first?** Frontier's roughness was intentional, but it also enabled The DAO—code that wouldn't have passed later auditing standards.

5. **Alternative forks**: What if the community had chosen a different solution to The DAO (e.g., irregular state change, blacklist, do nothing)?

---

## Bridge to Era 7

By late 2017, Ethereum had survived its first crisis and proven programmable blockchain viable:

**What Was Established**:
- General-purpose smart contracts work at scale
- EVM as the dominant execution environment
- Ethereum can survive contentious hard forks (barely)
- ICOs as a new fundraising mechanism
- ERC-20 as the token standard

**What Remained Unsolved**:
- **Scalability**: Ethereum could handle ~15 TPS; CryptoKitties showed limits
- **Security**: Smart contract bugs remained common
- **Proof of Stake**: Casper development ongoing but not deployed
- **Governance**: No clear process for contentious decisions

**The Coming Boom**: 2017's ICO mania would stress-test the network and bring regulatory attention. DeFi primitives (MakerDAO, 0x) would launch, laying groundwork for DeFi Summer.

**What came next** (Era 7, 2017-2019):
- **2017**: ICO boom; $6B+ raised
- **December 2017**: CryptoKitties congests network
- **2018**: Bear market; 90%+ price drops
- **2018-2019**: Early DeFi (MakerDAO, Uniswap V1, Compound)
- **2019**: EIP-1559 proposed

Era 7 would see the **ICO Boom and Bust**—massive speculation, regulatory response, and the quiet development of DeFi infrastructure.
