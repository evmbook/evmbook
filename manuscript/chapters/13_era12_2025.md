# Era 12: 2025+ — Current State & Emerging Trends

## Overview

The cryptocurrency ecosystem in 2025 shows maturation across multiple dimensions: Ethereum's continued evolution with account abstraction and L2 proliferation, Bitcoin's unexpected programmability renaissance, regulatory clarity in some jurisdictions, and the integration of AI with blockchain systems. The "multi-chain future" has materialized, though network effects continue to favor EVM-compatible environments.

## Bitcoin Programmability Renaissance

### BitVM: General Computation on Bitcoin

**Robin Linus's BitVM (October 2023)** proposed enabling arbitrary computation on Bitcoin using fraud proofs:

**Core insight**: Bitcoin Script can verify fraud proofs. If a prover makes an incorrect claim, any verifier can create a succinct proof of fraud that Bitcoin Script can validate.

**Architecture**:
```
1. Prover commits to computation trace (off-chain)
2. Challenge period allows disputes
3. If challenged: Binary search to find disagreement
4. Fraud proof: Single gate verification on-chain
5. Dishonest party loses deposit
```

[@misc_bitvm_2023]

**BitVM 1 limitations**:
- Two-party setup (prover vs. verifier)
- Complex pre-computation
- High on-chain costs for disputes

**BitVM 2 (2024)**: Expanded design enabling:
- n-of-n multi-party verification
- More efficient dispute resolution
- Bridge applications (BTCfi)

**Applications emerging (2024-2025)**:
- Bitcoin bridges with trust assumptions (1-of-n honest)
- ZK verification on Bitcoin
- Optimistic rollup settlement

### OP_CAT Revival

**BIP-420** proposes re-enabling OP_CAT (disabled by Satoshi in 2010):

**What OP_CAT does**: Concatenates two stack elements into one.

**Why it was disabled**: Security concerns about script complexity; Satoshi disabled multiple opcodes preemptively.

**Why re-enable now**: Enables covenants—scripts that restrict how outputs can be spent.

**Covenant use cases**:
| Application | How Covenants Help |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Vaults** | Time-delayed withdrawals with recovery paths |
| **Congestion control** | Batch transactions efficiently |
| **Rollups** | Enforce correct state transitions |
| **Bridges** | Trustless two-way pegs |
| **State channels** | More complex multi-party protocols |

**Controversy (2024-2025)**:
- **Proponents**: Enables Bitcoin smart contracts without changing core consensus
- **Opponents**: May enable tokens, NFTs, MEV, "Ethereum-like complexity"
- **Moderates**: Benefits outweigh risks; Bitcoin already has inscriptions

**Status**: Active debate; no activation timeline; community divided.

### Citrea: ZK-Validity Rollup on Bitcoin

**Citrea** (announced 2024) aims to bring EVM-compatible smart contracts to Bitcoin:

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|---------------|
| **Execution environment** | Full EVM compatibility |
| **Settlement layer** | Bitcoin (via BitVM) |
| **Data availability** | Bitcoin inscriptions + off-chain |
| **Proof system** | ZK-STARKs |
| **Bridge** | BitVM-based trust assumptions |

[@misc_citrea_2024]

**How it works**:
1. Users submit transactions to Citrea sequencer
2. Transactions execute in EVM environment
3. ZK proofs generated for state transitions
4. Proofs verified on Bitcoin via BitVM
5. State roots anchored to Bitcoin

**Significance**: If successful, brings EVM smart contracts to Bitcoin's security model—potentially more decentralized than Ethereum L2s.

**Challenges**:
- BitVM verification complexity
- Data availability costs on Bitcoin
- Bridge security assumptions
- Ecosystem bootstrapping

### Ordinals, Inscriptions, and BRC-20

**Casey Rodarmor's Ordinals** (January 2023) enabled inscribing arbitrary data on Bitcoin:

**Ordinal theory**: Each satoshi has a unique identity based on mining order.

**Inscriptions**: Embed data (images, text, code) in transaction witness.

**BRC-20** (March 2023): Token standard using inscription JSON:
```json
{"p":"brc-20","op":"deploy","tick":"ordi","max":"21000000","lim":"1000"}
```

**Impact (2023-2024)**:
- Demonstrated demand for Bitcoin programmability
- Fee revenue spike for miners
- Controversy: "spam" vs. legitimate use
- Catalyst for BitVM and OP_CAT discussions

**Runes** (April 2024): Alternative token protocol on Bitcoin:
- More efficient than BRC-20
- Uses OP_RETURN for data
- Designed for fungible tokens

### Bitcoin L2 Landscape (2025)

| Project | Type | Status | Notes |
|---------|------|--------|-------|
| **Lightning** | Payment channels | Live | Non-programmable; scaling payments |
| **Stacks** | PoX consensus | Live | Clarity language; STX token |
| **Liquid** | Federated sidechain | Live | 15 functionaries; limited decentralization |

## Ethereum Evolution (2024-2025)

### Dencun Upgrade (March 2024)

**EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding)** introduced blob transactions:

- New transaction type carrying "blob" data
- Blobs pruned after ~18 days (not permanent)
- Separate fee market for blob space
- L2 costs reduced 10-100x

**Impact**: L2 transaction costs dropped from $0.10-0.50 to $0.01-0.05.

### Pectra Upgrade (2025)

Key EIPs in Pectra:

| EIP | Feature | Impact |
|-----|---------|--------|
| **EIP-7702** | EOA → smart account delegation | Account abstraction without deploying |
| **EIP-7251** | Max validator balance increase | 2048 ETH cap; reduces validator count |
| **EIP-6110** | Deposit processing on-chain | Removes beacon chain dependency |
| **EIP-7002** | Execution layer exits | Validators can exit via EL |

**Account Abstraction progress**:
- ERC-4337 adoption growing (smart wallets)
- EIP-7702 enables EOAs to "borrow" smart account functionality
- Moving toward account abstraction as default

### L2 Ecosystem (2025)

| L2 | Type | TVL Rank | Notes |
|----|------|----------|-------|
| **Arbitrum One** | Optimistic | #1 | BOLD fraud proofs |
| **Optimism** | Optimistic | #2 | Superchain ecosystem |
| **Base** | Optimistic | #3 | Coinbase; Superchain member |
| **zkSync Era** | ZK | #4 | Native account abstraction |
| **Starknet** | ZK | #5 | Cairo language |
| **Polygon zkEVM** | ZK | — | Equivalence focus |
| **Scroll** | ZK | — | Bytecode-compatible |
| **Linea** | ZK | — | ConsenSys |

**Superchain model**: Optimism's vision of interconnected L2s sharing security and sequencing. Base, Mode, Zora, and others have joined.

**Based rollups**: L2s using L1 for sequencing (no centralized sequencer). Taiko implements this model.

## Ethereum Classic

### Olympia Testnet

ETC's Olympia testnet prepares for:
- EIP-1559 fee mechanism
- Shanghai-equivalent features
- Continued EVM compatibility

**Position**: ETC maintains "code is law" philosophy while cautiously adopting proven upgrades.

---

## Emerging Trends

### 1. Restaking (Eigenlayer paradigm)

**Concept**: Use staked ETH security for additional protocols.

| Protocol | Status | TVL |
|----------|--------|-----|
| **Eigenlayer** | Live | Significant |
| **Symbiotic** | Developing | — |
| **Karak** | Developing | — |

**Risks**: Cascading slashing, complexity, centralization.

### 2. Intent-based architecture

**Shift from transactions to intents**:
```
Old: "Swap 1 ETH for USDC on Uniswap"
New: "Get best price for 1 ETH → USDC"
```

Solvers compete to fulfill intents optimally.

### 3. Modular blockchain thesis

Separation of:
- **Execution**: Where transactions run (L2s)
- **Settlement**: Where finality occurs (L1s)
- **Data availability**: Where data is stored (Celestia, EigenDA)
- **Consensus**: Agreement on ordering

### 4. Cross-chain interoperability

| Solution | Type |
|----------|------|
| **LayerZero** | Message passing |
| **Axelar** | General message passing |
| **Hyperlane** | Modular interop |
| **IBC** | Cosmos ecosystem |
| **Native bridges** | L1 ↔ L2 |

- Formal verification at scale
- Privacy-preserving compliance
- Decentralized AI training

The story continues. This infrastructure—built on the cryptographic foundations of Era 0-4, the protocols of Era 5-8, and the scaling work of Era 9-11—now supports a global ecosystem of developers, users, and capital. What comes next remains to be written.
