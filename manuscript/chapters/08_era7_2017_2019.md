# Era 7: 2017-2019 — ICO Boom & DeFi Foundations

## Overview

2017 saw the greatest speculative frenzy in crypto history. Initial Coin Offerings raised billions of dollars, mostly for projects that would never ship. But beneath the noise, a quiet revolution was building: the financial primitives that would become DeFi. MakerDAO launched the first decentralized stablecoin. Bancor introduced automated market makers. Uniswap simplified them. By the end of 2019, the infrastructure for "DeFi Summer" was in place—waiting for the catalyst.

This era spans the ICO bubble, its regulatory aftermath, and the construction of DeFi's foundation layer.

---

## The ICO Phenomenon

### What Was an ICO?

An Initial Coin Offering allowed projects to raise funds by selling tokens:

```
Project publishes whitepaper
  → Creates ERC-20 token
  → Sells tokens for ETH (or BTC)
  → Promises future utility
  → No regulatory oversight (initially)
```

### The Numbers

| Year | Amount Raised | # of ICOs | Avg Raise |
|------|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| 2016 | $90M | 29 | $3.1M |
| 2017 | $5.6B | 875 | $6.4M |
| H1 2018 | $13.7B | 1,253 | $10.9M |
| H2 2018 | $3.4B | Declining | — |
| 2019 | $370M | 64 | $5.8M |

The bubble peaked in early 2018 before regulatory crackdowns and market collapse.

### Why ICOs Worked (Briefly)

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Accessibility** | Anyone could participate; no accredited investor requirements |
| **Global reach** | Projects raised from worldwide participants |
| **Liquidity** | Tokens listed on exchanges immediately |
| **FOMO** | Early ICOs returned 10-100x, driving speculation |
| **Regulatory arbitrage** | No clear securities laws applied |

### Notable ICOs

| Project | Date | Raised | Outcome |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| Filecoin | Sep 2017 | $257M | Launched 2020 |
| Tezos | Jul 2017 | $232M | Launched 2018 (after lawsuit) |
| EOS | Jun 2017-Jun 2018 | $4.1B | Launched; controversial |
| Bancor | Jun 2017 | $153M | Launched; AMM pioneer |
| Status | Jun 2017 | $270M | Messaging app; slow progress |
| BAT | May 2017 | $35M | Launched; Brave browser |
| Polkadot | Oct 2017 | $144M | Launched 2020 [@misc_polkadot_2016] |

### The Dark Side

Most ICO projects failed or were outright scams:

| Issue | Prevalence |
|-------|------------|
| **Never shipped** | ~80% of 2017 ICOs |
| **Exit scams** | Numerous (Bitconnect, OneCoin, etc.) |
| **Regulatory violations** | Most US-accessible ICOs |
| **Token utility** | Rarely matched claims |

### Regulatory Response

| Jurisdiction | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| **US (SEC)** | DAO Report (2017): tokens can be securities; subsequent enforcement |
| **China** | Complete ICO ban (Sep 2017) |
| **South Korea** | ICO ban (Sep 2017) |
| **Switzerland** | FINMA guidance; "Crypto Valley" approach |
| **Singapore** | MAS guidance; selective enforcement |

The SEC's Howey Test became central: Is this an "investment contract"?

## Token Standards Mature

### ERC-20: The Fungible Token Standard

Proposed by Fabian Vogelsteller and Vitalik Buterin (November 2015), formalized 2017.

```solidity
interface IERC20 {
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256);
    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
}
```

**Impact**: Universal standard enabled:
- Exchange listing without custom integration
- Wallet support across all tokens
- DeFi composability

[@eip_vogelsteller_erc20_2015]

### ERC-721: The NFT Standard

Proposed by William Entriken, Dieter Shirley (Dapper Labs), Jacob Evans, Nastassia Sachs (January 2018).

Key difference from ERC-20: Each token has unique `tokenId`.

```solidity
interface IERC721 {
    function balanceOf(address owner) external view returns (uint256);
    function ownerOf(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (address);
    function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) external;
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) external;
}
```

**Impact**: Enabled CryptoKitties (November 2017), which congested Ethereum and demonstrated NFT demand.

[@eip_entriken_erc721_2018]

### ERC-1155: Multi-Token Standard

Proposed by Enjin (June 2018). Single contract for multiple token types—fungible and non-fungible.

**Impact**: Gaming items, collectible sets, batch transfers.

---

## MakerDAO: Decentralized Stablecoin

### The Problem

Crypto needed stability. Options in 2017:
- **Tether (USDT)**: Centralized, opaque reserves, counterparty risk
- **Volatility**: ETH/BTC unusable for loans or commerce

### MakerDAO's Solution

Create DAI: a USD-pegged stablecoin backed by overcollateralized crypto.

```
User deposits ETH as collateral
  → Opens CDP (Collateralized Debt Position)
  → Mints DAI (borrowed against collateral)
  → If collateral value falls, position liquidated
```

[@online_makerdao_whitepaper_2017]

### The CDP System

| Parameter | Value (2017-2018) |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Collateral ratio | 150% minimum |
| Stability fee | Variable (interest on DAI debt) |
| Liquidation penalty | 13% |
| Collateral | ETH only (Single-Collateral DAI) |

**Example**:
- Deposit 1 ETH worth $200
- Borrow up to 133 DAI (at 150% ratio)
- If ETH price falls and ratio drops below 150%, liquidation

### Governance

MKR token holders govern the system:
- Set stability fees
- Add collateral types
- Emergency shutdown capability

MKR is burned when stability fees are paid, creating deflationary pressure if the system is healthy.

### Multi-Collateral DAI (November 2019)

Expanded beyond ETH:
- Multiple collateral types (BAT, USDC, wBTC, etc.)
- DAI Savings Rate (DSR): Interest on deposited DAI
- More complex but more resilient

---

## Bancor: AMM Pioneer

### The Idea

Bancor proposed automated market makers for tokens without requiring counterparties:

> "Liquidity for the long tail of tokens"

Instead of order books, use a **bonding curve** formula.

[@whitepaper_bancor_2017]

### Bancor's Formula

```
Price = Reserve / (Supply × CW)
```

Where:
- Reserve = ETH (or BNT) backing the token
- Supply = Token supply
- CW = Connector Weight (determines price curve steepness)

### Why Bancor Mattered

| Innovation | Significance |
|------------|--------------|
| **No order book** | Liquidity always available |
| **Algorithmic pricing** | Price adjusts with trades |
| **Permissionless listing** | Anyone could add tokens |
| **Smart token concept** | Tokens with built-in convertibility |

### Bancor's Limitations

- Complex mechanism (multi-token "relay" pools)
- BNT token requirement in most pools
- Front-running vulnerability (no slippage protection)
- June 2018: $23.5M hack via compromised wallet

## Uniswap: Simplicity Wins

### Origin Story

**Hayden Adams**, a mechanical engineer laid off from Siemens, learned to code and built Uniswap after reading about Vitalik Buterin's Reddit post on on-chain AMMs.

[@blog_adams_uniswap_2018]

### Uniswap V1 (November 2018)

Radical simplicity:

```
x × y = k
```

Where:
- x = Reserve of token A
- y = Reserve of token B
- k = Constant (unchanged by trades)

That's it. No governance tokens. No complex curves. Just ETH-token pairs with constant product.

### Why Simpler Was Better

| Bancor | Uniswap V1 |
|--------|------------|
| Multiple connector tokens | ETH pairs only |
| Variable connector weights | Fixed 50/50 ratio |
| Complex smart tokens | Simple ERC-20 pairs |
| BNT required | No native token |
| Professional traders focus | Anyone can provide liquidity |

### The Gas Advantage

Uniswap V1 swap: ~46,000 gas
Bancor swap: ~150,000+ gas

On a congested network, this mattered enormously.

### Liquidity Provider Tokens

Uniswap introduced LP tokens:
- Deposit ETH + token → Receive LP tokens
- LP tokens represent share of pool
- Withdraw: return LP tokens → Receive share of reserves + fees

This became the standard for DeFi liquidity provision.

### Uniswap V1 by Numbers

| Metric (by end 2019) | Value |
|---------------------|-------|
| Liquidity | ~$25M |
| Daily volume | ~$2-5M |
| Pools | ~1,500 |
| Protocol fee | 0% (all to LPs) |

---

## Compound: Algorithmic Lending

### The Problem

DeFi needed lending:
- Earn interest on idle assets
- Borrow against crypto without selling
- No KYC, global access

### Compound V1 (September 2018)

Robert Leshner built algorithmic money markets:

```
Deposit assets → Receive cTokens (interest-bearing)
Borrow → Pay variable interest
Interest rate = f(utilization)
```

### Interest Rate Model

```
Utilization = Borrowed / Supplied
Interest Rate = Base + (Utilization × Multiplier)
```

Higher utilization → Higher rates → Incentivizes deposits

### cTokens: Receipt Tokens

When you deposit:
- 100 DAI → Receive 100 cDAI (initially)
- cDAI exchange rate increases over time
- Withdraw: cDAI → More DAI than deposited

This "rebasing receipt token" pattern influenced ERC-4626 (vault standard).

### Compound V2 (May 2019)

Key improvements:
- Cross-asset borrowing (deposit ETH, borrow DAI)
- Shared liquidity pools
- COMP governance token (June 2020, just outside this era)

---

## Other DeFi Foundations

### 0x Protocol (August 2017)

Off-chain order matching, on-chain settlement:
- Order books without gas costs for every order
- "Relayers" host order books
- Settlement on Ethereum
- ZRX governance token

### Kyber Network (February 2018)

On-chain liquidity aggregation:
- Multiple reserve types (AMM, market makers, etc.)
- Instant token swaps
- KNC token for fees

### dYdX (October 2017)

Decentralized margin trading:
- Leverage on Ethereum
- Short selling
- Eventually moved to StarkEx L2

[@misc_dydx_2017]

### Set Protocol (July 2018)

Tokenized baskets ("Sets"):
- Index funds on-chain
- Rebalancing strategies
- Influenced later index protocols

---

## CryptoKitties: NFT Moment

### The Launch (November 2017)

Dapper Labs launched CryptoKitties—collectible digital cats on Ethereum.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Sales in first month | $6.7M |
| Highest sale (Genesis) | $117,712 |
| % of Ethereum transactions | 25% at peak |

### Why It Mattered

1. **Proved NFT demand**: People would pay for digital scarcity
2. **Exposed Ethereum limits**: Network congested for days
3. **Demonstrated ERC-721**: Standard worked at scale
4. **Mainstream coverage**: Non-crypto media attention

### Network Congestion

CryptoKitties transactions filled blocks, spiking gas prices from ~20 gwei to 200+ gwei. This was an early warning of Ethereum's scalability constraints.

## Market Cycle

### The Bubble (2017)

| Asset | Jan 2017 | Dec 2017 Peak | Return |
|-------|----------|---------------|--------|
| ETH | $8 | $1,400 | 175x |
| BTC | $1,000 | $19,000 | 19x |
| Total crypto market | $18B | $830B | 46x |

### The Crash (2018)

| Asset | Peak | Bottom (Dec 2018) | Drawdown |
|-------|------|-------------------|----------|
| ETH | $1,400 | $84 | -94% |
| BTC | $19,000 | $3,200 | -83% |
| Most ICO tokens | — | — | -95% to -100% |

### The Build Phase (2018-2019)

While prices collapsed, builders built:
- Uniswap launched November 2018
- Compound V2 May 2019
- Multi-collateral DAI November 2019

The infrastructure for DeFi Summer (2020) was constructed during the bear market.

## Common Misattributions

### 1. "Uniswap invented AMMs"

**Reality**: Bancor launched an AMM on Ethereum in June 2017, over a year before Uniswap. Academic AMMs (Hanson's LMSR) predate both. Uniswap's contribution was **simplification**.

**Confidence**: HIGH

### 2. "ICOs were all scams"

**Reality**: While most failed, legitimate projects emerged: Ethereum itself (2014), Filecoin, Polkadot, Chainlink, and others that shipped working products.

**Confidence**: HIGH

### 3. "DeFi started in 2020"

**Reality**: DeFi Summer (2020) was the **growth phase**. The building phase was 2017-2019. MakerDAO's DAI launched December 2017; Uniswap November 2018.

**Confidence**: HIGH

---

## Open Questions

1. **Were ICOs net positive?** They funded some legitimate projects but also massive fraud. Did innovation outweigh harm?

2. **Why did constant product win?** Bancor's formula was more flexible. Was Uniswap's simplicity the deciding factor, or network effects?

3. **Could DeFi have emerged without the ICO boom?** The bubble funded infrastructure development during the bear market.

4. **What killed ICOs?** Regulatory crackdown, market crash, or failure to deliver on promises?

5. **ERC-20 alternatives**: Could a better token standard have emerged? Was ERC-20's simplicity its strength or weakness?

---

## Bridge to Era 8

By late 2019, the infrastructure for DeFi Summer was in place:

**What Was Established**:
- Stablecoins (DAI) for DeFi primitives
- AMMs (Uniswap V1) for permissionless trading
- Lending protocols (Compound) for yield
- Token standards (ERC-20, ERC-721) for assets
- Oracle infrastructure (Chainlink) for price feeds

**What Remained Unsolved**:
- **Adoption**: DeFi had <$1B TVL; still niche
- **Gas costs**: High fees during congestion
- **Scalability**: No L2 solutions deployed
- **User experience**: Complex, risky, technical

**The Catalysts**: COVID-19 pandemic, central bank money printing, and low interest rates would create conditions for explosive DeFi growth. Liquidity mining (pioneered by Compound) would provide the spark.

**What came next** (Era 8, 2020):
- **March 2020**: "Black Thursday" crashes ETH 50%+
- **June 2020**: COMP distribution begins "DeFi Summer"
- **August 2020**: Yam, food tokens, yield farming mania
- **September 2020**: UNI airdrop; SushiSwap vampire attack
- **November 2020**: ETH 2.0 Beacon Chain launches

Era 8 would be **DeFi Summer**—when the infrastructure built in the bear market met massive demand and liquidity mining created a new financial system.
