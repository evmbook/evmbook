# Era 10: 2022 — Collapses & The Merge

## Overview

2022 delivered crypto's reckoning. A cascade of collapses—Terra, Three Arrows Capital, Celsius, Voyager, FTX—destroyed hundreds of billions in value and exposed the industry's overleveraged foundations. Yet amid the wreckage, Ethereum achieved its most significant technical milestone: The Merge eliminated proof of work, reducing energy consumption by 99.95%. The year demonstrated both crypto's fragility when built on unsound economics and its resilience when built on sound cryptography.

## The Terra/Luna Collapse

### What Was Terra?

**Terra** was an algorithmic stablecoin ecosystem:
- **UST**: "Stablecoin" maintaining $1 peg algorithmically
- **LUNA**: Governance token; absorbed volatility
- **Anchor Protocol**: Offered 20% APY on UST deposits

**Mechanism**:
```
When UST > $1: Mint UST by burning LUNA → Arbitrage profit
When UST < $1: Burn UST to mint LUNA → Arbitrage profit

Stability depends on demand for LUNA to absorb selling pressure
```

### The Fatal Flaw

The system was **reflexively unstable**:
- UST demand driven by unsustainable 20% yields
- Yields subsidized by depleting reserves
- When confidence broke, death spiral was inevitable

```
UST depegs slightly
  → Holders panic, sell UST
  → More LUNA minted to absorb selling
  → LUNA price crashes
  → Less value to back UST
  → UST depegs further
  → Repeat until worthless
```

### The Collapse (May 7-13, 2022)

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| May 7 | Large UST sells on Curve ($85M) |
| May 8 | UST depegs to $0.98; LFG deploys BTC reserves |
| May 9 | UST at $0.60; LUNA down 50% |
| May 10 | UST at $0.30; LUNA down 96% |
| May 11 | UST at $0.15; LUNA at $0.01 |
| May 13 | Terra blockchain halted; ~$45B destroyed |

### Casualties

| Entity | Loss |
|--------|------|
| UST holders | ~$18B market cap → ~$0 |
| LUNA holders | ~$40B market cap → ~$0 |
| Anchor depositors | Principal lost |
| Three Arrows Capital | Heavily exposed; triggered cascade |

### Warning Signs Ignored

- **Critics warned**: Multiple analysts identified reflexivity risk
- **Unsustainable yields**: 20% APY with no clear revenue source
- **Centralized reserves**: Bitcoin reserves controlled by LFG
- **No circuit breakers**: Mint/burn continued during collapse

### Aftermath

- Do Kwon fled; arrest warrant issued (South Korea)
- Terra 2.0 launched (new chain, no algorithmic stablecoin)
- Regulatory scrutiny of stablecoins intensified
- "Algorithmic stablecoin" became discredited category

## The Contagion Cascade

### Three Arrows Capital (3AC)

**Background**: Premier crypto hedge fund founded by Su Zhu and Kyle Davies.
- AUM: ~$10B at peak
- Highly leveraged positions
- Major Terra/LUNA exposure

**Collapse**:

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Jun 14 | 3AC fails margin calls |
| Jun 17 | Defaults on $670M Voyager loan |
| Jul 1 | 3AC files for bankruptcy (BVI) |

**Debts**: $3.5B+ owed to creditors including Genesis, Voyager, Celsius.

[@misc_3ac_collapse_2022]

### Celsius Network

**Background**: Crypto lending platform; "be your own bank" marketing.
- Users deposited crypto for yield
- Celsius lent out deposits
- 1.7M users; $12B deposits at peak

**Collapse**:

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Jun 12 | Celsius halts withdrawals |
| Jun 13 | Community panic; token drops 70% |
| Jul 13 | Celsius files Chapter 11 |

**Problem**: Celsius made risky loans (including to 3AC) and invested in illiquid assets. When withdrawals exceeded available liquidity, insolvency became apparent.

### Voyager Digital

**Background**: Crypto brokerage; publicly traded.

**Collapse**:

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Jun 22 | 3AC default announced ($670M exposure) |
| Jul 1 | Voyager halts withdrawals |
| Jul 5 | Voyager files Chapter 11 |

### BlockFi

**Background**: Crypto lending; raised from investors including Coinbase Ventures.

**Collapse**:

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Jun 2022 | FTX provides $250M credit facility |
| Nov 2022 | FTX collapses |
| Nov 28 | BlockFi files Chapter 11 |

BlockFi's fate was sealed when its rescuer (FTX) collapsed.

## FTX Collapse

### What Was FTX?

FTX was the second-largest crypto exchange:
- Founded by Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), 2019
- Rapid growth through derivatives and low fees
- $32B valuation (January 2022)
- Major political donations; effective altruism association
- Stadium naming rights (FTX Arena, Miami)

### The Revelation (November 2022)

**November 2**: CoinDesk reports Alameda Research balance sheet shows heavy reliance on FTT (FTX's token).

**The problem**:
- Alameda (SBF's trading firm) held billions in illiquid FTT
- FTT value depended on FTX's success
- If FTT crashed, Alameda was insolvent
- FTX had lent customer funds to Alameda

### The Collapse

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Nov 2 | CoinDesk balance sheet report |
| Nov 6 | Binance announces FTT sell-off |
| Nov 7 | FTX experiences $6B withdrawals |
| Nov 8 | Binance announces (then cancels) acquisition |
| Nov 9 | FTX halts withdrawals |
| Nov 11 | FTX files Chapter 11 |
| Nov 12 | ~$400M "hacked" from FTX wallets |
| Dec 12 | SBF arrested in Bahamas |

[@misc_ftx_collapse_2022]

### What Actually Happened

Investigations revealed:
- FTX lent $10B+ of customer funds to Alameda
- Alameda lost money on bad trades and investments
- Customer funds used to cover Alameda losses
- Accounting obscured missing funds ("fiat@" account)
- Executives knew funds were misappropriated

### The Trial (2023)

SBF convicted on seven counts:
- Wire fraud
- Securities fraud
- Money laundering conspiracy
- Sentence: 25 years (March 2024)

### Broader Impact

- $8B+ in customer funds missing
- Contagion: BlockFi, Genesis, others collapsed
- Regulatory backlash accelerated
- "Not your keys, not your coins" validated again

## The Merge: Ethereum's Technical Triumph

### What Was The Merge?

The Merge replaced Ethereum's proof-of-work consensus with proof-of-stake on **September 15, 2022**.

```
Pre-Merge: Miners compete; ~15M ETH/year issuance
Post-Merge: Validators stake; ~1M ETH/year issuance (90% reduction)
```

[@misc_ethereum_merge_2022]

### Timeline to The Merge

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| Dec 2020 | Beacon Chain launches (PoS testnet) |
| Dec 2021 | Kintsugi testnet |
| Mar 2022 | Kiln testnet |
| Jun 2022 | Ropsten merge |
| Jul 2022 | Sepolia merge |
| Aug 2022 | Goerli merge |
| Sep 6, 2022 | Bellatrix upgrade |
| Sep 15, 2022 | Paris upgrade (The Merge) |

### How It Worked

**Before (PoW)**:
- Execution layer (transactions, EVM)
- Miners produced blocks
- ~15 second block times

**After (PoS)**:
- Execution layer (same)
- Consensus layer (Beacon Chain validators)
- 12 second slots; 32 slot epochs
- Validators propose/attest to blocks

**The Transition**:
- Beacon Chain ran parallel since December 2020
- At "Terminal Total Difficulty," execution layer merged with consensus layer
- No chain halt; users experienced seamless transition

### Technical Achievement

The Merge replaced consensus mechanism of a $200B+ network with:
- Zero downtime
- No fund loss
- No chain split (ETH remained unified)
- Years of testing and coordination

This was comparable to "changing an airplane engine mid-flight."

### Energy Impact

| Metric | Pre-Merge | Post-Merge | Change |
|--------|-----------|------------|--------|
| Energy consumption | ~80 TWh/year | ~0.01 TWh/year | -99.95% |
| Carbon footprint | ~35M tonnes CO2 | Negligible | -99.99% |

The environmental criticism of Ethereum was largely resolved.

### Staking Economics

**Validator requirements**:
- 32 ETH stake (~$40,000 at 2022 prices)
- Run execution + consensus clients
- Maintain uptime (slashing for offline/misbehavior)

**Rewards**:
- Attestation rewards
- Block proposal rewards
- MEV (via MEV-Boost)

**Staking yield**: ~4-6% APR (variable based on participation)

### Ethereum Classic Continuation

**ETC maintained proof of work**:
- Miners migrated from ETH to ETC
- Hash rate increased ~20x after Merge
- "Code is law" philosophy extended to consensus mechanism

ETC became the largest proof-of-work EVM chain.

## Ronin Bridge Hack

### The Attack (March 29, 2022)

Axie Infinity's Ronin bridge was hacked for **$625 million**—the largest DeFi hack in history.

**How it happened**:
- Ronin used 9-of-9 multisig for bridge validation
- 5-of-9 controlled by Sky Mavis (Axie developer)
- Attackers (Lazarus Group, North Korea) compromised 4 Sky Mavis keys
- 1 additional key from Axie DAO (stale permission from November 2021)
- 5 signatures obtained = bridge drained

**Timeline**:

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Mar 23 | Attack occurs |
| Mar 29 | Attack discovered (6 days later) |
| Apr 2022 | Binance leads $150M recovery round |
| Sep 2022 | US Treasury sanctions attackers |

[@misc_ronin_hack_2022]

### Lessons

- **Multisig centralization**: 5-of-9 with 4 keys at one entity is effectively 1-of-2
- **Key hygiene**: Stale permissions enabled attack
- **Detection delay**: 6 days to notice $625M missing
- **Bridge risk**: Cross-chain bridges are high-value targets

---

## Other Notable Events

### Tornado Cash Sanctions (August 2022)

**OFAC sanctioned Tornado Cash** smart contract addresses:
- First sanctions on code/protocol rather than entity
- Arrested Dutch developer (Alexey Pertsev)
- Exchanges delisted; GitHub removed repo
- Privacy vs. compliance debate intensified

### Nomad Bridge Hack (August 2022)

$190M drained from Nomad bridge:
- Exploit was so simple anyone could copy attack transactions
- "Crowd-sourced" hack as random addresses drained funds
- Highlighted bridge vulnerability

### Wormhole Hack (February 2022)

$320M exploit on Wormhole bridge:
- Attacker minted unbacked wrapped ETH on Solana
- Jump Crypto (Wormhole backer) replaced funds
- Raised questions about "decentralized" bridges with centralized backstops

## Market Dynamics

### The Bear Market

| Asset | Peak (Nov 2021) | Bottom (2022) | Drawdown |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|----------|
| BTC | $69,000 | $15,500 (Nov) | -77% |
| ETH | $4,860 | $880 (Jun) | -82% |
| SOL | $260 | $8 (Dec) | -97% |
| Total market | $3T | $800B | -73% |

### Leverage Unwinding

The collapses weren't just market downturns—they exposed:
- Rehypothecation of customer funds
- Undisclosed leverage
- Interconnected counterparty risk
- Fraud and mismanagement

### Flight to Self-Custody

Hardware wallet sales surged:
- Ledger: Record sales post-FTX
- Trezor: Record sales post-FTX
- Cold storage adoption increased

"Not your keys, not your coins" became actionable advice.

## EVM Relevance

### The Merge's EVM Impact

| Aspect | Change |
|--------|--------|
| Block times | 12 seconds (fixed) vs. ~13 seconds (variable) |
| Block production | Deterministic proposer selection |
| Finality | ~15 minutes (2 epochs) |
| Reorg risk | Reduced after finalization |

EVM execution remained identical; consensus changed.

### ETC Positioning

Ethereum Classic maintained:
- Original PoW consensus
- EVM compatibility
- "Immutable" philosophy (no DAO-style forks)
- Largest PoW smart contract platform post-Merge

### Collapse Impact on EVM Ecosystem

- Reduced TVL across DeFi protocols
- Increased scrutiny of centralized infrastructure
- Accelerated L2 development (lower stakes = more experimentation)
- Flight from yield farming to productive DeFi

---

## Common Misattributions

### 1. "The Merge reduced gas fees"

**Reality**: The Merge changed consensus, not capacity. Gas fees are determined by block space demand. L2s reduce fees; The Merge didn't directly.

**Confidence**: HIGH

### 2. "FTX was hacked"

**Reality**: FTX failed due to fraud—customer funds lent to Alameda, not stolen by external hackers. The post-collapse $400M "hack" was separate from the main loss.

**Confidence**: HIGH

### 3. "Terra was a Ponzi scheme"

**Reality**: Terra was better described as a flawed algorithmic stablecoin with unsustainable subsidies. Unlike a Ponzi, it had an explicit mechanism (mint/burn); the mechanism just didn't work under stress.

**Confidence**: MEDIUM (definitional debate)

---

## Open Questions

1. **Regulatory outcome**: Will 2022 collapses lead to effective regulation or overreach?

2. **Centralization pressure**: Did the failures push users toward more centralized solutions (regulated exchanges)?

3. **Algorithmic stablecoins**: Is the concept dead, or will better designs emerge?

4. **Bridge security**: Can cross-chain bridges ever be secure enough for significant value?

5. **DeFi resilience**: Why did DeFi protocols largely survive while centralized entities collapsed?

---

## Bridge to Era 11

By end of 2022, the ecosystem had survived existential stress:

**What Was Established**:
- Proof of Stake works at scale (The Merge)
- DeFi is more resilient than CeFi (no major protocol collapses)
- Regulatory clarity emerging (through enforcement)
- L2s maturing as scaling solution
- Staking as yield source

**What Was Destroyed**:
- Algorithmic stablecoins (Terra/UST)
- Centralized lenders (Celsius, BlockFi, Voyager)
- Hedge funds with excessive leverage (3AC)
- Major centralized exchange (FTX)
- Industry reputation (fraud prosecutions)

**Lessons Learned**:
- "Not your keys, not your coins" validated
- Centralized entities require proof of reserves
- Algorithmic stablecoins need overcollateralization
- Contagion spreads through centralized intermediaries

**What came next** (Era 11, 2023-2024):
- **2023**: Shapella upgrade (staking withdrawals)
- **2023**: AI/crypto intersection (ChatGPT era)
- **2024**: Bitcoin ETF approval
- **2024**: Ethereum ETF approval
- **2024**: Dencun upgrade (proto-danksharding)

Era 11 would see **Recovery and Maturation**—the survivors would rebuild, regulators would act, and the foundation for the next cycle would form.
