# Era 11: 2023-2024 — Recovery & Institutional Integration

## Overview

The crypto ecosystem emerged from 2022's wreckage transformed. Fraudsters faced accountability while legitimate infrastructure strengthened. Ethereum completed its most significant upgrade since The Merge—EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding) reduced L2 costs by 10-100x. Most remarkably, traditional finance arrived: spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in January 2024, followed by Ethereum ETFs in May. The industry matured from speculative frontier to regulated asset class, though debates continued about what that maturation sacrificed.

## The Accountability Phase (2023)

### Criminal Prosecutions

| Defendant | Charges | Outcome |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Sam Bankman-Fried | Wire fraud, securities fraud | Convicted Nov 2023; 25 years |
| Do Kwon | Fraud, securities violations | Arrested Mar 2023; extradition |
| Su Zhu | Contempt of court | Arrested Sep 2023; 4 months |
| Alex Mashinsky (Celsius) | Fraud, market manipulation | Arrested Jul 2023; pending |
| 3AC liquidators | Recovery proceedings | Ongoing |

### Civil Enforcement (SEC)

| Date | Target | Allegation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Jun 2023 | Coinbase | Operating unregistered exchange |
| Jun 2023 | Binance | Unregistered exchange; mishandling funds |
| Oct 2023 | Kraken | Unregistered staking service |
| 2023-2024 | Various tokens | Securities violations |

**Gary Gensler's position**: Most tokens are securities; most exchanges are unregistered.

### Industry Response

- Legal challenges to SEC jurisdiction
- Migration to non-US jurisdictions for some projects
- Increased compliance spending
- Delisting of tokens deemed securities risk

---

## Shanghai/Shapella Upgrade (April 12, 2023)

### What It Enabled

The Merge (September 2022) locked staked ETH. Shanghai enabled **withdrawals**.

**Pre-Shanghai**:
- Validators could stake but not unstake
- Staked ETH illiquid since December 2020
- Liquid staking derivatives (stETH, rETH) provided liquidity

**Post-Shanghai**:
- Full withdrawals enabled
- Partial withdrawals (rewards) automatic
- Validator exit possible

### The "Bank Run" That Wasn't

**Fears**: Mass exodus of validators would crash ETH price.

**Reality**:
- Orderly withdrawal queue
- Net **inflows** after initial withdrawals
- Price remained stable
- Demonstrated staking model durability

| Metric | Pre-Shanghai | Post-Shanghai (1 month) |
|--------|--------------|-------------------------|
| Staked ETH | 18.2M | 19.5M |
| Validators | 566,000 | 590,000+ |
| Exit queue | N/A | Manageable |

### Staking Landscape Maturation

**Liquid staking grew**:
- Lido: ~30% of staked ETH
- Rocket Pool: Decentralized alternative
- Centralized staking (Coinbase, Kraken)

**Concerns**:
- Lido dominance (centralization risk)
- Regulatory pressure on staking services
- Kraken shutdown staking for US users

---

## EIP-4844: Proto-Danksharding (March 13, 2024)

### The Problem

L2s (Arbitrum, Optimism, etc.) posted transaction data to Ethereum L1 as calldata:
- Calldata expensive (~16 gas/byte)
- L2 fees still $0.10-0.50 during high demand
- Data availability costs dominated L2 expenses

### The Solution: Blobs

EIP-4844 introduced **blob-carrying transactions**:

```
Regular transaction: calldata (permanent, expensive)
Blob transaction: blob data (temporary, cheap)
```

**Blobs**:
- ~128 KB data attachments
- Pruned after ~18 days (not permanent)
- Separate fee market from execution gas
- Targeted 3 blobs/block (max 6)

[@eip_proto_danksharding_2022]

### Impact

| Metric | Pre-4844 | Post-4844 |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Arbitrum swap cost | $0.20-0.50 | $0.01-0.05 |
| Optimism swap cost | $0.15-0.40 | $0.01-0.03 |
| Base transaction | $0.10-0.30 | $0.001-0.01 |

L2s became economically viable for sub-dollar transactions.

### Blob Fee Dynamics

```
Blob base fee adjusts like EIP-1559:
- If blobs > target: fee increases
- If blobs < target: fee decreases
- Separate market from execution gas
```

During low demand, blob fees approach zero. L2s benefit most during off-peak.

### Toward Full Danksharding

EIP-4844 is "proto" because:
- No data availability sampling yet
- Blobs processed by all nodes (not scalable indefinitely)
- Full Danksharding will enable 16+ MB/block

## Spot Bitcoin ETF (January 10, 2024)

### The Approval

After a decade of rejections, the SEC approved **11 spot Bitcoin ETFs** simultaneously.

| Issuer | Ticker | Day 1 Volume |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| BlackRock | IBIT | $1.0B |
| Fidelity | FBTC | $684M |
| Grayscale | GBTC | $2.3B (selling) |
| ARK/21Shares | ARKB | $278M |
| Bitwise | BITB | $237M |
| Others | Various | Varied |

**Total Day 1 volume**: ~$4.6B

[@misc_bitcoin_etf_2024]

### Market Impact

| Period | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Pre-approval | BTC rallied from $25K to $45K (anticipation) |
| Launch week | Initial "sell the news" dip |
| Q1 2024 | BTC rallied to $73K all-time high |
| Ongoing | Steady inflows ($10B+ by mid-2024) |

### GBTC Discount Collapse

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) had traded at discount to NAV since 2021:
- Conversion to ETF enabled redemptions
- Discount collapsed from -40% to ~0%
- Outflows as investors moved to lower-fee ETFs

### Significance

- **Institutional access**: Pension funds, RIAs can now allocate
- **Custody solved**: ETF issuers handle custody
- **Regulatory clarity**: SEC acknowledged Bitcoin as commodity
- **Mainstream legitimacy**: "Bitcoin is in your 401k"

---

## Ethereum ETF (May 2024)

### Approval Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Jan 2024 | Applications filed |
| May 2024 | SEC approves 19b-4 filings |
| Jul 2024 | S-1 effectiveness; trading begins |

### Key Difference: No Staking

SEC required **no staking** in approved ETFs:
- ETFs hold unstaked ETH only
- Staking deemed potential security
- Lower yields than staking alternatives

### Market Response

Ethereum ETF launches saw:
- Lower volumes than Bitcoin ETF
- Grayscale outflows (fee-driven)
- BlackRock, Fidelity accumulated

### Implications

- ETH classified as commodity (not security) for ETF purposes
- Staking remains regulatory gray area
- Path cleared for other crypto ETFs (Solana filed)

## L2 Proliferation

### The Cambrian Explosion

2023-2024 saw dozens of L2s launch or mature:

**Optimistic Rollups**:
| L2 | Launch | Notable |
|----|--------|---------|
| Arbitrum One | 2021 | Largest TVL |
| Optimism | 2021 | Superchain vision |
| Base | Aug 2023 | Coinbase; rapid growth |
| Mantle | Jul 2023 | BitDAO treasury |
| Blast | Feb 2024 | Native yield |

**ZK Rollups**:
| L2 | Launch | Notable |
|----|--------|---------|
| zkSync Era | Mar 2023 | Native account abstraction |
| Polygon zkEVM | Mar 2023 | Bytecode equivalence |
| Linea | Jul 2023 | ConsenSys |
| Scroll | Oct 2023 | Community-focused |
| Starknet | Nov 2022 | Cairo language |

### The Superchain Model

**Optimism's vision**: Network of interoperable L2s sharing:
- Sequencer set
- Bridge infrastructure
- Governance (Optimism Collective)

**Members**: Optimism, Base, Zora, Mode, others

### Based Rollups

**Concept**: Use Ethereum L1 for sequencing (no centralized sequencer)
- **Taiko**: First based rollup mainnet
- Benefits: Censorship resistance, credible neutrality
- Trade-off: Higher latency than centralized sequencers

### Airdrop Season

Major L2 token distributions:

| Token | Date | Eligible | Value |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| ARB | Mar 2023 | Arbitrum users | $1.2B+ |
| OP | Jun 2022 + ongoing | Optimism users | Multiple rounds |
| STRK | Feb 2024 | Starknet users | ~$700M |
| ZK | Jun 2024 | zkSync users | Pending |

## MiCA Implementation (EU)

### What Is MiCA?

Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation:
- First comprehensive crypto framework (EU)
- Stablecoin requirements (June 2024)
- Full CASP licensing (December 2024)

### Key Requirements

**Stablecoins**:
- Reserve requirements
- Redemption rights
- Issuer authorization

**Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs)**:
- Authorization required
- Custody standards
- Consumer protection

### Tether (USDT) Implications

- USDT compliance uncertain
- Some EU exchanges delisted USDT
- USDC (Circle) positioned as compliant alternative

### Global Influence

MiCA becoming template for:
- UK regulation
- Singapore frameworks
- Potential US legislation model

---

## Privacy Developments

### Tornado Cash Legal Battle

**Alexey Pertsev**:
- Arrested August 2022 (Netherlands)
- Trial 2024
- Convicted of money laundering facilitation (May 2024)
- 5+ years sentence

**Roman Storm** (US):
- Arrested August 2023
- Trial pending
- Arguments: Code is speech; no control over protocol

### Samourai Wallet (April 2024)

**Arrests**: Keonne Rodriguez, William Lonergan Hill
- Charged with money laundering, operating unlicensed money transmitter
- Non-custodial mixing service
- Significant for non-custodial tools

### Privacy Implications

- Enforcement targeting developers, not just users
- Chilling effect on privacy tool development
- Ongoing constitutional challenges (code as speech)

---

## Restaking Emergence

### Eigenlayer

**Concept**: "Restaking" uses staked ETH to secure additional services.

```
Validator stakes 32 ETH for Ethereum
  → Also opts into Eigenlayer
  → Provides security for AVSs (Actively Validated Services)
  → Earns additional yield
  → Accepts additional slashing risk
```

**Growth**:
- Launched 2023
- $15B+ TVL by mid-2024
- Largest DeFi protocol by TVL

### AVS Ecosystem

Services secured by restaked ETH:
- Oracles
- Bridges
- Data availability layers
- Sidechains

### Risks

- **Cascading slashing**: Failure in one AVS affects others
- **Complexity**: Validators managing multiple commitments
- **Centralization**: Large operators dominate

---

## Technical Standards Evolution

### Account Abstraction Progress

**ERC-4337** adoption grew:
- Smart wallets (Safe, Argent)
- Paymasters (gas abstraction)
- Bundlers and infrastructure

**EIP-7702** (proposed for Pectra):
- EOAs can delegate to smart contracts
- Enables AA features without deploying contract wallet
- Lighter weight than full ERC-4337

### New Token Standards

| Standard | Purpose | Adoption |
|----------|---------|----------|
| ERC-6551 | Token-bound accounts (NFTs with wallets) | Growing |
| ERC-4626 | Tokenized vaults | Widespread |
| ERC-7579 | Modular smart accounts | Emerging |

### ETC Olympia Testnet

Ethereum Classic prepared for:
- EIP-1559 fee mechanism
- Shanghai-equivalent features
- Continued EVM compatibility

---

## Common Misattributions

### 1. "The SEC approved Bitcoin"

**Reality**: SEC approved **ETFs** that hold Bitcoin. SEC has not changed position on most tokens as potential securities.

**Confidence**: HIGH

### 2. "EIP-4844 is Danksharding"

**Reality**: EIP-4844 is **Proto**-Danksharding. Full Danksharding (data availability sampling, 16+ MB blocks) comes later.

**Confidence**: HIGH

### 3. "Crypto is now regulated"

**Reality**: Regulatory frameworks are still emerging. MiCA is implemented; US lacks comprehensive legislation. "Clarity" is relative.

**Confidence**: HIGH

---

## Open Questions

1. **Regulatory trajectory**: Will US follow MiCA model or continue enforcement-based approach?

2. **L2 sustainability**: Can L2s remain decentralized as they scale?

3. **Restaking risks**: Are restaking systems creating systemic risk?

4. **ETF impact**: Does ETF access change who participates in crypto?
