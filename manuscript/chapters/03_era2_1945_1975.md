# Era 2: 1945-1975 — Information Theory & Modern Cryptographic Foundations

## Overview

Claude Shannon transformed cryptography from an art into a mathematical science. His 1948 and 1949 papers defined information, entropy, and provable security—concepts that underpin every modern cryptographic system. This era also saw the development of standardized encryption (DES) and the infrastructure of government signals intelligence (NSA). While most cryptographic research remained classified, the theoretical foundations were laid for the public key revolution that would follow.

The Cold War drove massive investment in computing and cryptography, creating the infrastructure—and the paranoia—that would shape both government and cypherpunk approaches to security.

## Geopolitical Context

### The Cold War Computing Race

The period from 1945-1975 was shaped by superpower competition:

**The Sputnik Effect (1957)**: Soviet satellite launch sparked US investment in science and technology:
- DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) created 1958
- Massive funding for computer science research
- ARPANET emerged from this investment

**Military-Industrial Complex**: Computing development was inseparable from defense:
- IBM's early revenue largely from defense contracts
- University research funded by military grants
- NSA as the world's largest employer of mathematicians

**Classification Culture**: Government controlled cryptographic knowledge:
- Most advances classified
- Export restrictions on encryption
- Researchers discouraged from publishing

**EVM Relevance**: This era established the relationship between government and cryptography—a tension that would define the cypherpunk movement and cryptocurrency's philosophical foundations.

## Shannon's Information Theory

### The 1948 Paper

"A Mathematical Theory of Communication" (Bell System Technical Journal, 1948) established:

**Information**: Measured in bits; the reduction of uncertainty.

**Entropy**: The average information content of a message source.

```
H(X) = -Σ p(x) log₂ p(x)
```

Where p(x) is the probability of symbol x.

[@article_shannon_communication_1948]

### Key Concepts

| Concept | Definition | Relevance |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| **Bit** | Binary digit; basic unit of information | Computers; blockchain data |
| **Entropy** | Measure of randomness/uncertainty | Key strength; random number generation |
| **Channel capacity** | Maximum reliable transmission rate | Network throughput |
| **Redundancy** | Predictable patterns in data | Enables compression; aids cryptanalysis |

### The Noisy Channel Theorem

Shannon proved:
- Any channel has a theoretical capacity
- Error-correcting codes can approach this capacity
- Below capacity, errors can be made arbitrarily small

**Implication**: Information can be transmitted reliably through imperfect channels—foundation for all digital communication.

---

## Shannon's Secrecy Systems

### The 1949 Paper

"Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems" (published; written 1945 as classified report) applied information theory to cryptography.

[@article_shannon_secrecy_1949]

### Perfect Secrecy

**Definition**: A cipher provides perfect secrecy if the ciphertext reveals no information about the plaintext.

**Formal statement**:
```
P(plaintext | ciphertext) = P(plaintext)
```

Knowing the ciphertext doesn't change the probability of any plaintext.

### The One-Time Pad

**Only perfectly secure cipher**: One-time pad (Vernam cipher, 1917).

**Requirements**:
1. Key as long as message
2. Key truly random
3. Key used only once
4. Key kept secret

**Operation**:
```
Ciphertext = Plaintext ⊕ Key (XOR)
Plaintext = Ciphertext ⊕ Key
```

**Why perfect**: Every possible plaintext maps to the observed ciphertext with equal probability.

**Why impractical**: Key distribution problem—need secure channel to share key as long as every message.

### Unicity Distance

Shannon defined **unicity distance**: The amount of ciphertext needed to uniquely determine the key.

```
U = H(K) / D
```

Where:
- H(K) = key entropy (bits)
- D = plaintext redundancy (bits/character)

For English (D ≈ 3.2 bits/char) with 26! substitution cipher:
```
U ≈ 88.4 / 3.2 ≈ 28 characters
```

With ~28 characters of ciphertext, a substitution cipher has only one plausible solution.

### Confusion and Diffusion

Shannon identified two properties for strong ciphers:

| Property | Definition | Effect |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **Confusion** | Complex relationship between key and ciphertext | Makes key extraction hard |
| **Diffusion** | Spreading plaintext influence across ciphertext | Hides statistical patterns |

Modern ciphers (AES, etc.) combine both through substitution (confusion) and permutation (diffusion).

## NSA and Government Cryptography

### NSA Formation (1952)

**National Security Agency** created by secret presidential directive:
- Successor to AFSA (Armed Forces Security Agency)
- Consolidated US signals intelligence
- Largest employer of mathematicians
- Budget and activities classified

### GCHQ Continuation

British **Government Communications Headquarters** continued Bletchley Park's work:
- Signals intelligence
- Cryptographic research
- Close cooperation with NSA ("Five Eyes")

### Classification Regime

Most cryptographic research became classified:
- Government controlled standards
- Academic work discouraged
- "Cryptography gap" between classified and public knowledge

**Consequence**: Public key cryptography would be independently discovered by government (GCHQ, ~1970) and academics (1976), with government work remaining secret until 1997.

## Computer Development

### Early Commercial Computers

| Computer | Year | Significance |
|----------|------|--------------|
| UNIVAC I | 1951 | First commercial computer (US Census) |
| IBM 701 | 1952 | IBM's first commercial scientific computer |
| IBM 7090 | 1959 | Widely used scientific/military computer |
| PDP-1 | 1960 | First minicomputer; time-sharing |
| IBM System/360 | 1964 | Standardized mainframe architecture |

### Time-Sharing

**Concept**: Multiple users share computer resources simultaneously.

**Developments**:
- Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS), MIT, 1961
- Multics (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service), 1965
- Unix (1969) simplified Multics concepts

**Relevance**: Shared computing required access control and security—problems still central today.

### Unix (1969)

Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs created Unix:
- Simplified Multics concepts
- Introduced "everything is a file" philosophy
- Permission model (read/write/execute for owner/group/others)
- Written in C (also created at Bell Labs)

**Security Model**:
```
-rwxr-xr-x 1 owner group 1234 Jan 1 00:00 file
 │││ │││ │││
 │││ │││ └── others: read+execute
 │││ └───── group: read+execute
 └──────── owner: read+write+execute
```

**Legacy**:
- Linux (and thus most servers, including blockchain nodes) descends from Unix
- Unix permission model still governs access control
- The "root" superuser concept
- Process isolation and multi-user security

**EVM Relevance**: Unix's permission model—owner, group, others—prefigures blockchain access control. Smart contract ownership patterns and access modifiers echo these concepts.

### ARPANET (1969)

First packet-switched computer network:
- Funded by DARPA
- Connected research institutions
- Became foundation for internet
- No encryption built in (added later)

**Key Design Decisions**:

| Decision | Rationale | Long-term Impact |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| Packet switching | Survive partial network failure | Internet architecture |
| Decentralized | No single point of failure | P2P networks, blockchain |
| Open protocols | Enable interoperability | Public internet standards |
| No built-in encryption | Performance; trusted environment | Decades of insecure networking |

**Initial Nodes (1969)**:
1. UCLA
2. Stanford Research Institute
3. UC Santa Barbara
4. University of Utah

**EVM Relevance**: ARPANET's decentralized, packet-switched design directly influenced blockchain networking. The absence of built-in encryption—a decision made for a trusted academic environment—created the security problems that would motivate encryption tools and eventually cryptocurrency.

### TCP/IP (1974)

Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn specified TCP/IP:
- Transmission Control Protocol: Reliable, ordered delivery
- Internet Protocol: Addressing and routing

TCP/IP became the universal network protocol, enabling the global internet that blockchains would later operate on.

## Symmetric Cryptography Advances

### Feistel Networks (1973)

**Horst Feistel** at IBM developed iterative cipher structure:

```
Round function:
L(i+1) = R(i)
R(i+1) = L(i) ⊕ F(R(i), K(i))
```

**Properties**:
- Same structure for encryption and decryption (reverse key order)
- Security from iterated simple rounds
- Foundation for DES and many block ciphers

### Lucifer (1971)

IBM's **Lucifer** cipher:
- Feistel structure
- 128-bit key, 128-bit blocks (later 64-bit)
- Precursor to DES

---

## Data Encryption Standard (DES)

### Development (1973-1977)

**NBS (National Bureau of Standards)** solicited cipher proposals:
- IBM submitted Lucifer derivative
- NSA involvement in modifications
- Adopted as federal standard (1977)

### DES Specification

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Block size | 64 bits |
| Key size | 56 bits (64 with parity) |
| Rounds | 16 |
| Structure | Feistel network |

### The Key Size Controversy

**Original Lucifer**: 128-bit key
**DES**: 56-bit key

**Concerns**:
- Diffie and Hellman argued 56 bits too short
- NSA suspected of weakening key length
- Conspiracy theories about "trapdoors"

**Retrospective**: 56-bit key broken by brute force (1999). No trapdoors found—NSA appears to have optimized for 1970s computing constraints while ensuring government could break it if needed.

### S-Boxes

DES uses 8 substitution boxes (S-boxes):
- 6 bits input → 4 bits output
- NSA-modified from IBM originals
- Design criteria kept secret until 1990s
- Later revealed to resist differential cryptanalysis (unknown to public in 1977)

---

## Theoretical Foundations

### Computational Complexity (1965-1975)

| Concept | Year | Significance |
|---------|------|--------------|
| P vs NP | 1971 | Defines tractable vs. intractable problems |
| NP-completeness | 1971 | Cook-Levin theorem |
| Polynomial reduction | 1972 | Karp's 21 NP-complete problems |

**Relevance**: Cryptographic security often relies on problems believed to be in NP but not P.

### Randomness and Entropy

**Kolmogorov complexity**: Shortest program that outputs a string.

**Random string**: One with Kolmogorov complexity equal to its length (incompressible).

**Practical implication**: Key generation requires truly random (or cryptographically random) sources.

## EVM Relevance

### Information-Theoretic Concepts

| Shannon Concept | EVM Application |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Entropy** | Private key generation must have sufficient entropy |
| **Bits** | All blockchain data is bits; efficient encoding matters |
| **Redundancy** | Compression before hashing; storage optimization |
| **Channel capacity** | Block size limits; throughput constraints |

### Perfect Secrecy Trade-offs

One-time pads are impractical, so blockchains use:
- **Computational security**: Hard to break in practice
- **Public key cryptography**: Avoid key distribution problem
- **Hash functions**: One-way, not reversible

### DES → AES → Blockchain

DES established the paradigm:
- Government involvement in standards
- Open publication of algorithm
- Key size debates
- Block cipher structure

AES (2001) replaced DES; AES principles influence blockchain encryption choices.

## Common Misattributions

### 1. "Shannon invented the bit"

**Reality**: Shannon formalized the bit as a unit of information. The binary digit concept existed earlier (Leibniz, Boolean algebra). Shannon gave it precise mathematical meaning.

**Confidence**: HIGH

### 2. "DES was secretly backdoored by the NSA"

**Reality**: Despite conspiracy theories, no backdoors have been found. NSA modifications actually improved resistance to differential cryptanalysis (known to NSA, not public). The 56-bit key was weak, but that's not a backdoor.

**Confidence**: HIGH

### 3. "One-time pads are the only secure encryption"

**Reality**: One-time pads provide perfect (information-theoretic) security. Computational security (AES, etc.) is sufficient for practical purposes. Perfect security requires impractical key distribution.

**Confidence**: HIGH

---

## Open Questions

1. **NSA knowledge**: What cryptographic advances did NSA develop that remain classified?

2. **Complexity theory gaps**: Will P vs NP ever be resolved? What happens to cryptography if P = NP?

3. **Shannon's unpublished work**: Did Shannon develop other cryptographic concepts never published?

4. **DES key size**: Was the 56-bit key a deliberate weakness or a genuine engineering compromise for 1970s hardware?

5. **Lost research**: How much cryptographic research was classified and never published, potentially delaying public advances?

## Bridge to Era 3

By 1975, the foundations were in place but key problems remained unsolved:

**What Was Solved**:
- Information theory and entropy (Shannon)
- Symmetric encryption design (Feistel, DES)
- Basic computer networking (ARPANET, TCP/IP)
- Time-sharing and multi-user security concepts

**What Remained Unsolved**:
- **Key distribution problem**: How to securely share encryption keys without a pre-existing secure channel?
- **Digital signatures**: How to prove authorship without revealing secrets?
- **Decentralized consensus**: How to agree on state across untrusted participants?

**The Stage Was Set**:
- Computing power sufficient for public key operations
- Network infrastructure connecting researchers globally
- Academic culture ready to challenge government monopoly on cryptography
- Mathematical foundations mature enough for the breakthroughs

**What came next** (Era 3, 1976-1990):
- **1976**: Diffie-Hellman publish "New Directions in Cryptography"
- **1977**: RSA provides first practical public key cryptosystem
- **1979**: Merkle trees enable efficient verification
- **1982**: Byzantine Generals Problem formalized
- **1985**: Zero-knowledge proofs introduced

Era 3 would be the **Public Key Revolution**—solving the key distribution problem and enabling digital signatures, laying the cryptographic foundation for Bitcoin and Ethereum.
