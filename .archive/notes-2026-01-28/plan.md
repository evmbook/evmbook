# Research Plan & Priorities

## Status: Research Complete

All research phases (R1-R4) are complete. The book is ready for publishing (Phase 14).

## Completed Research Phases

### Phase R1: Foundation (Complete)
- [x] Research infrastructure (docs, sources, history)
- [x] Primitive dossiers (10 initial)
- [x] Priority era chapters (3)
- [x] Manuscript scaffolding

### Phase R2: Expansion (Complete)
- [x] Expanded primitives to 27 total (~42,000 words)
- [x] All 13 era chapters complete (~6,600 lines)
- [x] Consistent structure (Timeline, Open Questions, Bridge sections)
- [x] 100+ BibTeX entries in library.bib
- [x] 80+ verified claims in CLAIMS_LEDGER.md

### Phase R3: Era Chapters (Complete)
- [x] Era 0-12 all expanded with full content
- [x] Cross-references to primitives added
- [x] Citations integrated throughout

### Phase R4: Book Integration Assessment (Complete)
- [x] Compared all chapters to primitives
- [x] Found chapters already comprehensive (600-1000+ lines each)
- [x] Enhanced Ch 13 with client diversity metrics
- [x] No major expansions needed

## Why Priority Eras Were Chosen

### Era 3 (1976-1990): Cryptographic Toolkit
Foundation for all blockchain cryptography. Addressed Chapter 07's missing citations for Lamport, Diffie-Hellman, Merkle.

### Era 4 (1990-2008): Cypherpunks & Digital Cash
Most misattributed era. Established that PoW predates Bitcoin (Dwork/Naor 1992), smart contracts predate Ethereum (Szabo 1994).

### Era 8 (2020): DeFi Summer
Connected AMM academic precursors (Hanson LMSR 2003) to DeFi deployment.

## Resolved Research Questions

| Question | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| Szabo smart contracts 1994 vs 1996 | Both valid: 1994 = concept; 1996 = expanded article |
| Mojo Nation tokens | Verified via primary sources (Feb 2000 technical overview) |
| Vitalik Reddit AMM post | Found: Oct 3, 2016, r/ethereum |
| LMSR → Uniswap lineage | Documented via Adjacent Research; full lineage traced |
| Constant product formula origin | Academic precursors exist; Uniswap popularized |

## Remaining Items (Low Priority)

These are optional future work, not blocking publishing:

1. [ ] Archive critical blog URLs via Wayback Machine
2. [ ] Expert review of contested claims
3. [ ] Interview-based verification where possible

## Research Methodology (Reference)

### Source Priority
1. Primary sources first (papers, whitepapers, EIPs)
2. Cross-reference with secondary (Wikipedia, news)
3. Flag uncertainties (known_gaps.md)

### Attribution Audit Process
1. Who is commonly credited?
2. What primary sources support this?
3. Are there earlier precursors?
4. Is common attribution accurate or simplified?
