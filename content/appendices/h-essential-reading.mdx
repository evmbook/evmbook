## Conclusion

This list is comprehensive but not exhaustive. The ecosystem moves fast—papers become outdated, new protocols emerge, and best practices evolve.

The most important resources are:

1. **Primary sources**: Whitepapers and documentation from protocols you're building on
2. **Security resources**: Always current with the latest vulnerability patterns
3. **Community discussions**: Where new ideas are debated before they become standards

Read widely, but read critically. Not every paper or protocol stands the test of time. The best learning comes from building—use these resources to inform your work, not replace it.
