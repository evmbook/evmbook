# Appendix A: Fork History

This appendix documents the major network upgrades (hard forks) for both Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).

## The DAO Fork and Chain Split

On July 20, 2016, at block 1,920,000, the Ethereum network experienced a contentious hard fork in response to The DAO hack:

- **Ethereum (ETH)** — Implemented the fork to return stolen funds
- **Ethereum Classic (ETC)** — Continued the original chain without the irregular state change

This split created two separate chains sharing a common history up to block 1,920,000.

## Key Differences After The Merge

After September 2022, ETH and ETC diverged significantly:

| Aspect | Ethereum (ETH) | Ethereum Classic (ETC) |
|--------|----------------|------------------------|
| Consensus | Proof of Stake | Proof of Work |
| Block time | 12 seconds (fixed) | ~13 seconds (variable) |
| Finality | ~13 minutes (economic) | ~10 minutes (probabilistic) |
| Monetary policy | Deflationary (burn) | Fixed emission schedule |
| Validator/Miner role | 32 ETH stake | ASIC and GPU mining |

## EIP Compatibility

ETC maintains EVM compatibility with ETH through coordinated upgrades:

| ETH Fork | ETC Equivalent | Divergences |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| Byzantium | Atlantis | Full compatibility |
| Constantinople | Agharta | Full compatibility |
| Istanbul | Phoenix | Full compatibility |
| Berlin | Magneto | Full compatibility |
| London | Mystique | No EIP-1559 (fee burn) |
| Shanghai | Spiral | No PoS EIPs |
| Decun, Pectra, Fusaka | Olympia | No PoS EIPs |
