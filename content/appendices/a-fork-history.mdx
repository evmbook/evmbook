# Appendix A: Fork History

This appendix documents the major network upgrades (hard forks) for both Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).

## The DAO Fork and Chain Split

On July 20, 2016, at block 1,920,000, the Ethereum network experienced a contentious hard fork in response to The DAO hack:

- **Ethereum (ETH)** — Implemented the fork to return stolen funds
- **Ethereum Classic (ETC)** — Continued the original chain without the irregular state change

This split created two separate chains sharing a common history up to block 1,920,000.

## Ethereum Classic Forks

| Fork Name | Block | Date | Notable Changes |
|-----------|-------|------|-----------------|
| Frontier | 0 | Jul 2015 | Genesis |
| Homestead | 1,150,000 | Mar 2016 | EIP-2, EIP-7, EIP-8 |
| DAO Fork | 1,920,000 | Jul 2016 | ETC continues unforked |
| Tangerine Whistle | 2,500,000 | Oct 2016 | Gas repricing |
| Spurious Dragon | 8,772,000 | Jan 2019 | Replay protection |
| Atlantis | 8,772,000 | Sep 2019 | Byzantium equivalence |
| Agharta | 9,573,000 | Jan 2020 | Constantinople equivalence |
| Phoenix | 10,500,839 | Jun 2020 | Istanbul equivalence |
| Thanos | 11,700,000 | Nov 2020 | DAG size reduction |
| Magneto | 13,189,133 | Jul 2021 | Berlin equivalence |
| Mystique | 14,525,000 | Feb 2022 | London equivalence (no EIP-1559) |
| Spiral | 19,250,000 | Feb 2024 | Shanghai equivalence (partial) |

## Ethereum Forks

| Fork Name | Block | Date | Notable Changes |
|-----------|-------|------|-----------------|
| Frontier | 0 | Jul 2015 | Genesis |
| Homestead | 1,150,000 | Mar 2016 | EIP-2, EIP-7, EIP-8 |
| DAO Fork | 1,920,000 | Jul 2016 | Irregular state change |
| Tangerine Whistle | 2,463,000 | Oct 2016 | Gas repricing |
| Spurious Dragon | 2,675,000 | Nov 2016 | State clearing |
| Byzantium | 4,370,000 | Oct 2017 | zkSNARK precompiles |
| Constantinople | 7,280,000 | Feb 2019 | Cheaper gas, CREATE2 |
| Istanbul | 9,069,000 | Dec 2019 | Gas adjustments |
| Muir Glacier | 9,200,000 | Jan 2020 | Difficulty bomb delay |
| Berlin | 12,244,000 | Apr 2021 | Access lists (EIP-2929) |
| London | 12,965,000 | Aug 2021 | EIP-1559 fee burn |
| Arrow Glacier | 13,773,000 | Dec 2021 | Difficulty bomb delay |
| Gray Glacier | 15,050,000 | Jun 2022 | Difficulty bomb delay |
| **The Merge** | 15,537,394 | Sep 2022 | **Transition to PoS** |
| Shanghai | 17,034,870 | Apr 2023 | Validator withdrawals |
| Dencun | 19,426,587 | Mar 2024 | EIP-4844 blobs |

## Key Differences After The Merge

After September 2022, ETH and ETC diverged significantly:

| Aspect | Ethereum (ETH) | Ethereum Classic (ETC) |
|--------|----------------|------------------------|
| Consensus | Proof of Stake | Proof of Work |
| Block time | 12 seconds (fixed) | ~13 seconds (variable) |
| Finality | ~13 minutes (economic) | ~10 minutes (probabilistic) |
| Monetary policy | Deflationary (burn) | Fixed emission schedule |
| Validator/Miner role | 32 ETH stake | GPU mining |

## EIP Compatibility

ETC maintains EVM compatibility with ETH through coordinated upgrades:

| ETH Fork | ETC Equivalent | Divergences |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| Byzantium | Atlantis | Full compatibility |
| Constantinople | Agharta | Full compatibility |
| Istanbul | Phoenix | Full compatibility |
| Berlin | Magneto | Full compatibility |
| London | Mystique | No EIP-1559 (fee burn) |
| Shanghai | Spiral | No withdrawals (not PoS) |

<Note>
ETC generally implements EVM-related EIPs while skipping consensus-related changes that assume Proof of Stake.
