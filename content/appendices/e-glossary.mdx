# Appendix E: Glossary

This glossary contains terms used throughout this book and in the broader EVM ecosystem.

## A

**Account**
An object containing an address, balance, nonce, and optional storage and code. An account can be a contract account or an externally owned account (EOA).

**Address**
A 20-byte (160-bit) identifier for an account. Derived from the rightmost 160 bits of the Keccak-256 hash of an ECDSA public key.

**Assert**
In Solidity, `assert(false)` compiles to `0xfe`, an invalid opcode that consumes all remaining gas. Use `assert()` for conditions that should never occur—indicates a bug if triggered.

## B

**Big-endian**
A byte ordering where the most significant byte is stored first. The EVM uses big-endian for most operations.

**Block**
A collection of transactions, a block header, and references to ommer blocks. Blocks are added by miners (PoW) or validators (PoS).

**Blockchain**
A sequence of blocks, each cryptographically linked to its predecessor, forming an immutable ledger.

**Bytecode**
Low-level instructions executed by the EVM. Compiled from high-level languages like Solidity or Vyper.

## C

**Consensus**
Agreement among nodes on the current state of the blockchain.

**Consensus Client**
In post-Merge Ethereum (PoS), the client responsible for the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Works alongside an execution client. Examples: Lighthouse, Prysm, Teku. Not required on PoW chains like Ethereum Classic.

**Consensus Rules**
The validation rules that full nodes follow to stay in consensus with other nodes.

**Contract Account**
An account containing code that executes when it receives transactions. Has no private key—controlled only by its code.

**Core Geth**
The primary execution client for Ethereum Classic, maintained as a fork of go-ethereum (Geth). Supports ETC mainnet (chainId 61) and Mordor testnet (chainId 63).

## D

**DAO**
Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Also refers to "The DAO" contract hacked in June 2016, which led to the ETH/ETC split.

**DApp**
Decentralized Application. A web application built on decentralized infrastructure, typically combining smart contracts with a frontend.

**Difficulty**
In Proof of Work, a network-wide setting controlling how much computation is required to mine a block.

**Digital Signature**
Cryptographic proof that a message was created by the holder of a specific private key.

## E

**ECDSA**
Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm. The cryptographic algorithm used to sign transactions and prove ownership of accounts.

**EIP**

Externally Owned Account. An account controlled by a private key, used by humans to interact with the blockchain.

**ERC**
Ethereum Request for Comments. A category of EIPs defining application-level standards (e.g., ERC-20 for tokens).

**Ethash**
The original Proof of Work algorithm used by Ethereum before The Merge and still used (as ETCHash) by Ethereum Classic.

**ETCHash**
The PoW mining algorithm used by Ethereum Classic since the Thanos upgrade (November 2020). A modification of Ethash that supports 4GB GPUs.

**Ether**
The native cryptocurrency of Ethereum and Ethereum Classic networks. Symbol: ETH (Ethereum) or ETC (Ethereum Classic).

**Ethereum Classic (ETC)**
The original Ethereum blockchain that continued without the DAO hard fork. Maintains Proof of Work consensus. ChainId 61 (mainnet), 63 (Mordor testnet).

**EVM**
Ethereum Virtual Machine. The stack-based virtual machine that executes bytecode. Shared by Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and other EVM-compatible chains.

**Execution Client**
Client software responsible for executing transactions and managing state (the EVM). On PoW chains like ETC, only an execution client is needed. Examples: Geth, Core Geth, Besu, Erigon.

## F

**Fallback Function**
A contract function called when no other function matches the call data, or when the contract receives plain ether.

**Faucet**
A service that dispenses free test ether for use on testnets.

**Finney**
A denomination of ether. 1 finney = 10^15 wei = 0.001 ether.

**Fork**
A change in protocol rules, or a divergence creating two competing chains. Can be "soft" (backward compatible) or "hard" (not backward compatible).

**Foundry**
A Rust-based Ethereum development toolkit. Includes Forge (testing), Cast (CLI), Anvil (local testnet), and Chisel (REPL).

## G

**Gas**
A unit measuring computational effort in the EVM. Each operation costs a specific amount of gas.

**Gas Limit**
The maximum gas a transaction can consume (set by sender) or a block can contain (set by network).

**Gas Price**
The amount of ether (in wei) the sender pays per unit of gas.

**Genesis Block**
The first block (block 0) of a blockchain.

**Geth**
Go Ethereum. The most widely used Ethereum client, written in Go.

## H

**Hardhat**
A popular Ethereum development framework for JavaScript/TypeScript, featuring Hardhat Network for local testing.

**Hard Fork**
A protocol change that is not backward compatible. Nodes must upgrade or they will follow a different chain.

**Hash**
A fixed-size output produced by a cryptographic hash function from variable-size input. Used extensively for data integrity and identification.

**HD Wallet**
Hierarchical Deterministic wallet. Uses a seed phrase to derive unlimited keys following BIP-32/39/44 standards.

## I

**ICAP**
Inter-exchange Client Address Protocol. An address encoding compatible with IBAN, using the XE prefix.

**Immutability**
The principle that deployed smart contract code cannot be changed. A core property of blockchain systems.

**Internal Transaction**
A message sent from one contract to another during execution. Not recorded as a separate transaction on-chain.

**IPFS**
