## About This Book

**Mastering EVM** is a comprehensive guide to the Ethereum Virtual Machine ecosystem, covering both Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) as the two flagship EVM implementations.

## Authors

**Christopher Mercer** — Author and orchestrator of this work. Christopher directed the vision, structure, and technical direction of *Mastering EVM*, shaping it into a fresh 2025-2026 resource for builders entering the EVM ecosystem.

**Claude** (Anthropic) — Writing collaborator. Claude contributed to research, drafting, and refinement of the technical content under Christopher's direction, serving in a role similar to a traditional ghostwriter or co-author.

This collaboration represents a new model of technical writing—human vision and orchestration combined with AI-assisted research and composition. We believe transparency about this process serves readers better than obscuring it.

- Evolution narratives showing how each primitive developed
- A different structure, voice, and 2026-native perspective
