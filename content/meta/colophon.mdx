## About This Book

**Mastering EVM (2025 Edition)** is a comprehensive guide to the Ethereum Virtual Machine ecosystem, covering both Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) as the two flagship EVM implementations.

## Authors

**B.L. Brocer** — Author and orchestrator of this work. B.L. directed the vision, structure, and technical direction of *Mastering EVM*, shaping it into a fresh 2025-2026 resource for builders entering the EVM ecosystem.

**Claude** (Anthropic) — Writing collaborator. Claude contributed to research, drafting, and refinement of the technical content under B.L.'s direction, serving in a role similar to a traditional ghostwriter or co-author.

This collaboration represents a new model of technical writing—human vision and orchestration combined with AI-assisted research and composition. We believe transparency about this process serves readers better than obscuring it.

## Publisher

**White B0x Inc.** — An independent technical publisher focused on blockchain and decentralized systems education.

## Acknowledgments

The Ethereum ecosystem has benefited from many educational resources over the years. We particularly respect the work of Andreas M. Antonopoulos and Gavin Wood, whose writings helped educate a generation of blockchain developers.
