## About This Book

**Mastering EVM** is a comprehensive guide to the Ethereum Virtual Machine ecosystem, covering both Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) as the two flagship EVM implementations.

## Author

Written by **Nakamoto Wei** — a collective pseudonym representing contributors to the Mastering EVM project. Like the cypherpunks who came before, we believe in code, not credentials.

Mastering EVM has been substantially rewritten, reorganized, and updated for 2025. While we build upon the foundational concepts of the original work, all content has been reformulated with:

- New examples using modern tooling
- Dual-chain (Ethereum + Ethereum Classic) coverage
- Updated content reflecting post-Merge reality
- Coverage of L2 scaling, DeFi, and zero-knowledge proofs
- A different structure and voice
