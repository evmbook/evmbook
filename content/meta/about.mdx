# About Mastering EVM

## A Living Book

The blockchain space moves at lightning speed. The original *Mastering Ethereum* was written with content reflecting February 2017—a lifetime ago in this industry. Since then, we've seen The Merge, Layer 2 scaling solutions, the DeFi explosion, and countless protocol upgrades.

**Mastering EVM** is designed as a living document that evolves with the ecosystem. We continuously update content to reflect the current state of EVM development, ensuring you're learning modern practices, not historical artifacts.

## Why This Book?

The Ethereum Virtual Machine powers one of the most significant technological revolutions of our time. Yet comprehensive, up-to-date educational resources remain scarce. Mastering EVM fills this gap.

We wrote this book because we believe:

1. **Knowledge should be free** — Technical education shouldn't be gatekept behind paywalls
2. **Both chains matter** — Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Ethereum (ETH) each represent valid visions for the EVM ecosystem
3. **Modern tooling deserves modern docs** — Most resources are outdated; we cover 2026 best practices
4. **Code speaks louder than credentials** — Anonymous contribution honors the cypherpunk tradition

## What You'll Learn

This book covers the complete EVM development journey:

- **Fundamentals**: Cryptography, accounts, transactions, and the EVM itself
- **Development**: Solidity, Vyper, testing, and deployment
- **Security**: Common vulnerabilities and how to prevent them
- **Advanced Topics**: DeFi protocols, L2 scaling, and zero-knowledge proofs
- **Dual-Chain**: Differences and similarities between ETH and ETC
- **Agentic Development**: AI-assisted coding for resource-constrained networks

## Who Should Read This

- Developers new to blockchain wanting a comprehensive introduction
- Experienced developers transitioning from other platforms
- Architects designing blockchain-based systems
- Security researchers auditing smart contracts
- Anyone curious about how the EVM actually works
