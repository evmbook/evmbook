# About Mastering EVM

## Why This Book?

The Ethereum Virtual Machine powers one of the most significant technological revolutions of our time. Yet comprehensive, up-to-date educational resources remain scarce. Mastering EVM fills this gap.

We wrote this book because we believe:

1. **Knowledge should be free** — Technical education shouldn't be gatekept behind paywalls
2. **Both chains matter** — Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Ethereum (ETH) each represent valid visions for the EVM ecosystem
3. **Modern tooling deserves modern docs** — Most resources are outdated; we cover 2025 best practices
4. **Code speaks louder than credentials** — Anonymous contribution honors the cypherpunk tradition

## What You'll Learn

This book covers the complete EVM development journey:

- **Fundamentals**: Cryptography, accounts, transactions, and the EVM itself
- **Development**: Solidity, Vyper, testing, and deployment
- **Security**: Common vulnerabilities and how to prevent them
- **Advanced Topics**: DeFi protocols, L2 scaling, and zero-knowledge proofs
- **Dual-Chain**: Differences and similarities between ETH and ETC

## Who Should Read This

- Developers new to blockchain wanting a comprehensive introduction
- Experienced developers transitioning from other platforms
- Architects designing blockchain-based systems
- Security researchers auditing smart contracts
- Anyone curious about how the EVM actually works

## The Nakamoto Wei Collective

We chose the pseudonym "Nakamoto Wei" as a deliberate homage to:

- **Satoshi Nakamoto** — Creator of Bitcoin, identity unknown
- **Wei Dai** — Inventor of b-money, referenced in the Bitcoin whitepaper
- **Wei** — The smallest unit of Ether (1 ETH = 10^18 wei)

The cypherpunk tradition values ideas over identities. We continue that tradition.
