## Remaining Gaps (Low Priority)

### Sources Needing Archival

Critical URLs that should be archived via Wayback Machine:

**High priority** (personal sites):
- weidai.com/bmoney.txt
- activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html
- hashcash.org/papers/hashcash.pdf
- vitalik.ca blog posts
- financialcryptography.com McCoy post-mortem

**Medium priority** (project docs):
- curve.fi/files/stableswap-paper.pdf
- uniswap.org whitepapers

**Already stable**: nakamotoinstitute.org, archive.org, bitcoin.org, ethereum.org, GitHub

### Contested Narratives

**Satoshi Identity**: CONTESTED by design. Document speculation without endorsing any theory.

**"Who invented X" disputes**: Credit synthesizers and popularizers, but document precursors.

| Topic | Simplified | Reality |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Proof of work | Bitcoin | Dwork/Naor (1992) → Hashcash (1997) → Bitcoin (2008) |
| AMMs | Uniswap | Hanson (2003) → Bancor (2017) → Uniswap (2018) |
| Smart contracts | Ethereum | Szabo (1994) → Ethereum (2015) |

## Future Research (Optional)

1. [ ] Archive critical blog URLs
2. [ ] Expert review of contested claims
3. [ ] Interview-based verification

These are not blocking publishing.
