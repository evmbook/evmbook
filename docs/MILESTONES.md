### Historical Research Log (2026-01-27)

**Verified Accurate:**
- Ch16 AMM: EtherDelta 2016, Bancor 2017, Uniswap Nov 2018
- Ch17 Lending: ETHLend 2017, Compound 2018, MakerDAO DAI Dec 2017
- Ch18 Governance: Multisigs → Compound Governor → veToken
- Ch21 Prediction: Augur ICO 2015, launch July 2018

**Minor Corrections Applied:**
- Ch22: Chainlink timeline clarified (whitepaper 2017, network 2019)
- Ch23: Raiden Network dates corrected (started 2015, not 2020)
