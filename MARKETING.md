## Master the Machine That Powers Web3

The Ethereum Virtual Machine runs billions of dollars in smart contracts across dozens of blockchain networks. Whether you're building on Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, or any EVM-compatible chain—**this is the book that will get you there.**

**Mastering EVM** takes you from curious developer to confident builder. We don't just show you *how* to write smart contracts. We show you *why* they work the way they do.

---

## What's Inside

### Part I: Foundations
Build your mental model of how the EVM actually works. Cryptography, accounts, transactions, and the execution environment that makes trustless computation possible.

### Part II: Development
Write production-ready smart contracts in Solidity and Vyper. Learn security patterns, token standards, oracle integration, and complete dApp architecture.

### Part III: Deep Dives
Go beyond the basics. Understand consensus mechanisms, DeFi protocols, Layer 2 scaling solutions, and zero-knowledge proofs.

### Part IV: Modern Practices
The frontier of blockchain development. How agentic coding multiplies developer effectiveness while encoding network principles directly into AI workflows.

## The Dual-Chain Perspective

A unique feature of this book: **we cover both major EVM implementations**.

| | Ethereum Classic (ETC) | Ethereum (ETH) |
|---|---|---|
| **Consensus** | Proof of Work | Proof of Stake |
| **Philosophy** | Immutability-first | Innovation-first |
| **Genesis** | July 30, 2015 | July 30, 2015 |
| **Fork** | — | Block 1,920,000 |

Understanding both chains gives you the complete picture of the EVM ecosystem. Where implementations differ, we clearly note the distinctions.

## Why This Book?

### Always Free
Technical education shouldn't be gatekept behind paywalls. Read online, download PDFs, fork the repo—**it's yours**.

### Always Current
The blockchain space moves fast. We continuously update content to reflect the current state of EVM development. No more learning from 2017 tutorials.

### Battle-Tested Content
Built on the foundation of *Mastering Ethereum (Open Edition)* by Andreas M. Antonopoulos and Gavin Wood, substantially rewritten and modernized for 2026.

### Modern Tooling
Foundry, Hardhat, ethers.js v6, Solidity 0.8.x—we cover the tools developers actually use today.
