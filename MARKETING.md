## Master the Machine That Powers Web3

The Ethereum Virtual Machine runs billions of dollars in smart contracts across dozens of blockchain networks. Whether you're building on Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, or any EVM-compatible chain—**this is the book that will get you there.**

**Mastering EVM** takes you from curious developer to confident builder. We don't just show you *how* to write smart contracts. We show you *why* they work the way they do—and how each primitive evolved to its current form.

---

## What's Inside

### Part I: The EVM Landscape (Chapters 1-3)
Understand the EVM in context: what it is today, how we got here from 1976 through 2026, and setting up your modern development environment with Foundry, viem, and TypeScript.

### Part II: Core Foundations (Chapters 4-7)
Build your mental model of how the EVM actually works. Cryptography, accounts, transactions, gas, and consensus mechanisms that make trustless computation possible.

### Part III: Smart Contract Development (Chapters 8-12)
Write production-ready smart contracts. Solidity fundamentals, advanced patterns (proxies, assembly), security, testing with Foundry, and deployment strategies.

### Part IV: EVM Internals (Chapters 13-14)
Go deep into the machine: stack, memory, storage, opcodes, and gas optimization techniques that separate junior from senior developers.

### Part V: The Application Layer (Chapters 15-22)
**The evolution narratives.** How each DeFi primitive developed—tokens, AMMs, lending, governance, NFT marketplaces, launchpads, prediction markets, and oracles. Code examples at each evolutionary stage.

### Part VI: Scaling & Infrastructure (Chapters 23-24)
Layer 2 solutions and zero-knowledge applications. From Plasma to rollups to ZK-EVMs—the full scaling story.

### Part VII: Building for the Real World (Chapters 25-27)
Regulatory landscape, bootstrapping an EVM ecosystem from scratch, and agentic development with AI assistants.

## The Dual-Chain Perspective

A unique feature of this book: **we cover both major EVM implementations**.

| | Ethereum Classic (ETC) | Ethereum (ETH) |
|---|---|---|
| **Consensus** | Proof of Work | Proof of Stake |
| **Philosophy** | Immutability-first | Innovation-first |
| **Genesis** | July 30, 2015 | July 30, 2015 |
| **Fork** | — | Block 1,920,000 |
| **2025 Upgrade** | Olympia (Treasury) | Pectra (AA) |

Understanding both chains gives you the complete picture of the EVM ecosystem. Where implementations differ, we clearly note the distinctions.

## Why This Book?

### Always Free
Technical education shouldn't be gatekept behind paywalls. Read online, download PDFs, fork the repo—**it's yours**.

### Always Current
Updated through 2026: ETF era, MakerDAO→Sky rebrand, Pump.fun, GENIUS Act, L2 dominance. No more learning from 2017 tutorials.

### Evolution Narratives
We don't just show you Uniswap V3—we show you EtherDelta → Bancor → Uniswap V1 → V2 → V3 → Curve → Aerodrome. Understanding the *why* makes you a better builder.

### Battle-Tested Foundation
Built on *Mastering Ethereum (Open Edition)* by Andreas M. Antonopoulos and Gavin Wood, substantially rewritten and expanded for 2026.

### Modern Tooling
Foundry, viem, wagmi, TypeScript, Solidity 0.8.26+—the tools developers actually use today.
